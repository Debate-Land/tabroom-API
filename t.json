A TFA State Champion, TOC top speaker, and one of the most successful debaters on the college circuit, Jon won the Golden Bear award at the University of Baylor's tournament, and advanced to the semifinals of the National Debate Tournament.

I would love for this event to make - please enter your students even if they're a little apprehensive! Getting feedback early on will help them with their piece development over the season. Duet is at one entry. I will keep this event open through this Friday but after that, we will plan on dropping Duet from the tournament. Students who are affected by this would be able to enter a different event if they so choose. I'm working to make sure I'm not missing emails - if you haven't gotten a response go ahead and send me a bump! Some are getting trapped in spam and I'll be checking out my spam folder as frequently as possible. I want to ensure you feel supported and get the answers you need!

You can tell we're nearing the tournament date as emails start to pop up more and more frequently. Here are a few crucial updates: The IE schedule was updated to add a third prelims round. Rounds are not beginning any earlier that day (we know it can be difficult to adjust transportation times) but we've lost some of our buffer time between rounds. Please explain to your students that it will be important for them to be expedient in getting to their rounds on time and communicating cross-entry. For those who are in Congress finals and extemp and are worried about getting to extemp draw round 1 on time - Congress finalists will be assigned to speak last in their first extemp rounds. We are still accepting nominations for the Jonathan Brody Award. Please send these to stephanie.cambra@rcisd.org A reminder that high school students cannot serve as judges at this tournament with the exception of Novice Extemp. Schools cannot enter a high school student to fulfill any of their judge obligations. Prose and Poetry rules vary from state to state. The time limit for Prose and Poetry will be 7 minutes with a 30-second grace. Students may perform woven programs or a single piece of literature. We would like to hire some more judges. If you have contacts in the area that would like to judge, please have them complete this form. If you or any of your judges who are coming to the tournament would be willing to judge beyond their obligation, we can offer a round-by-round contract for additional rounds judged. Our incredible booster club will ensure that there are vegetarian and vegan options in hospitality and concessions. I will be removing TBA entries from the tournament today. Get your entries updated accordingly, please! Questions? Feel free to shoot me an email!

First, thank you for supporting this tournament. We have tried to accommodate everyone that we could. A few hiccups along the way, but all in all, I think we have this thing under control as much as we can at this point. You probably noticed some stuff happening over the weekend. That's because I finally had the time to sit down and figure out where we were with judges. I discovered that the settings for judge requirements in LD/PF were set assuming single flighting. We are not doing that. As a consequence of that, I have gone through and changed many judge obligations. In many cases, it lowered the amount of money that you owed for hired judges. Second, I was able to confirm judges who had been added but we weren't aware that had been done. Finally, you need to check some obligations. For some judges who were listed as full commitments but now are needed for less, they were changed to a partial commitment from you, but also added a few rounds of hired judging. In short, we will try to keep track of what their partial commitment might be, but more than willing to pay for judging beyond that commitment. If you are a judge and receiving this email, check your Tabroom page. It should indicate that you have a judging assignment for this tournament. If you can't meet that commitment, please contact the appropriate persons. For VPF, VLD, and VCX. judge preferences will be opened tomorrow (September 6) at noon CDT. They will close at noon on Friday CDT. There will be no extensions or exceptions if you fail to complete them. Please let us know of any changes. The sooner the better. All judges should have paradigms on Tabroom.com. Not a requirement, but I really hate getting those emails complaining about some judge from some school not having a paradigm and what can you tell me about that person. I usually don't have an answer. Please help out by providing the information if you can. Expect more missives in the next couple of days.See you Friday."}, {"subject": "Mutual preferences and strikes", "sender": "David Huston", "recipients": "All", "sent": "2023-09-06T11:50:00Z", "text": "The mutual preferences for VCX and VLD have been set and are due to open in the next few minutes. VPF will allow up to 5 judge strikes. A few notes to follow First, expect changes. There will be judges who will bail on us at the last minute. Suddenly, people from some schools become available and schools would like to reduce what they owe for judges. Sounds like normal tournament stuff to me. In short, check your prefs/strikes many times before the deadline on Friday at noon CDT. We will try to keep you apprised of changes. Please be flexible. Prefs are a privilege, not a right. Play nice so we can continue to have nice things. Second, if you have conflicts, they need to be legit. If you are in the same prep group with others but don't share that prep with others from that same team, that may not necessarily be a conflict. We don't need to play a whole lot of games. As I've done with other tournaments, ask yourself this question, \"If my opponent had the same relationship with this judge as I do to this one, would I ask for a change?\" If the answer is yes, that's a conflict. If the answer is no, it's not a conflict. Don't conflict people just to limit the potential judges you might have. That's not ethical. Again, we want to keep nice things. Third, do the JV divisions have prefs/strikes? No, they don't. Your JV persons should not have the option to preference or strike judges. We reserve that only for the Varsity divisions. If you have reasons for why it's necessary to exclude someone from judging your students (looking for ethical and moral reasons here, not philosophical ones), let's talk. Finally, please meet the deadlines. You can print or record your prefs. I strongly encourage you to do so. The vast majority of issues with pref/strike sheets can be attributed to user error. Don't be that person. Again, we want to keep nice things. Thanks for attending the tournament. If you have questions, please feel free to ask. I'll do my best to provide answers. See you on Friday"}, {"subject": "World Schools Schedule Adjustment", "sender": "Jenn Melin", "recipients": "Judges in WSD", "sent": "2023-09-06T21:55:00Z", "text": "Good Evening, There has been an adjustment to the World Schools schedule to make Friday more manageable for students and coaches. Round 1 will now be impromptu with a mandatory judge training running concurrent to the start of prep at 4:30. Round 2 is your first prepared round. Round 3 has moved to Saturday morning and will be prepared and side locked off Round 2 so that each team gets a Prop and Opp on the prepared motion as expected. Everything shifts back on Saturday as a result. The schedule still has finals running on Saturday, but around Semis we will get a feel from the remaining teams about whether they want to push through or have an online round on Sunday. We have prepared for either contingency. We just wish to maintain some flexibility on the question as we know teams have already solidified travel plans, etc. prior to the schedule adjustment. The new schedule is live on the website, and linked here for your reference.If you have any questions or see any errors, please feel free to reach out. Additionally, please email me with names for your teams. Please note the students on each team so that I make sure to code them properly in the system. In keeping with World Schools norms, these typically include your school name and a color or school appropriate noun (ex: Colleyville Red or Colleyville Panthers). We look forward to seeing you on Friday!

Know that we are working hard to keep things up to date and current on the website in regards to entries, judges, and other stuff. First, remember how I told you in the first email that there would be changes? Well, there have been several. If you have debaters in VCX, VLD, and VPF, you know that you have the privilege of preferences and/or strikes. There have been subtractions and additions to all of those pools. Please go to your preferences/strikes later today to check to make sure everything is OK and you are good to go. Second, this is for those of you with entries in the JV debate divisions. Your current financial statement and judge obligations may be out of whack. The reason for that is simple. To keep JV competitors from entering prefs/strikes, I had to take away the pool from which judges were being pulled. Once prefs/strikes close tomorrow, I'm putting all of that back. It should then correct itself. I'll double check to make sure that it does. Stef will be letting you know later about registration and how to come into the building, etc. If you have IE issues, drops, etc. I am handling that kind of thing. At this point, if you want to add somebody to the tournament in debate, the answer is no. If you want to add somebody in IE's, that's a Stef question. We are committed to giving you a good tournament experience. We have an experienced tabroom ready to do their work. We are looking forward to the competition. We hope that you are, too.

Final Reminders and Pieces of Information", "sender": "Stef Cambra", "recipients": "All Registered Schools With Entries", "sent": "2023-09-07T22:37:00Z", "text": "Good evening! I love to send an email right before the tournament begins so it's easy to find in your inbox. We all know what an email inbox can look like this time of year... Please read this email carefully to help us have a successful start to the Grapevine Classic! I know it's a long one but it's an important one and this is way better than getting 14 bite-size emails where you have to collect the information like a scavenger hunt. So please - read and read carefully. :) We encourage schools to arrive about 45 minutes before their first round. School lets out at 4:00 PM so plan for end-of-school traffic. This year, we adjusted our schedules to allow for PFD, LD, and CX to begin at 5:00 instead of 4:30 so there isn't as crazy of a scramble with teachers leaving and competitors getting to rounds. Schools and judges will all enter through the main entrance! There will be signage and students to help direct you to the right place. Registration will open up at 3:15 and be in front of the auditorium. Coaches will be able to notify us of any changes to their entries as well as pick up their placards for Congress. You may even see a familiar face of Grapevine legend status! For schools that only have students entered in individual events: registration will be open at Cross Timbers Middle School in the library. The school-appointed coach or sponsor needs to handle tournament registration. Students cannot register themselves. For schools that arrive early: we will hold teams that arrive early in the auditorium. Some classes in the afternoon will be going on stage to rehearse. We ask that our guests be respectful and not get too loud to the point where students on stage can't focus. Once we get the \"all clear\" from our custodial staff, we will be able to move students into the SAC (a fancy name for the cafeteria). Hospitality: Hospitality will be in Gym 4 this year, which is a change from recent years. This change is due to two volleyball games going on that will take place in Gym 1 and Gym 2. Gym 4 is a little more tucked away so we will be sure to provide signage to help guide you. There will be vegetarian options. Hospitality will be set up and ready for guests prior to the tournament beginning! Concessions: Concessions will be set up in the SAC (a fancy name for the cafeteria). There will be vegetarian options - there will also be 35th Annual Grapevine Classic T-Shirts! All Friday and Sunday competition will take place at Grapevine High School. Individual Events and Congress Finals will take place at Cross Timbers Middle School on Saturday. The Middle school shares a parking lot with Grapevine High School. Please be sure all school judges know which building they need to be in. Judges are expected to arrive and check in 30 minutes before their first round. W9 - need a W9 to finish processing payment? You can find one here. If you are bringing a check with you, we will be sure to take note of your payment as it comes in. If you have submitted a PO, thank you! If you have not yet started processing payment for the tournament...why are you breaking our hearts? Please be sure that payment is processed efficiently - we rely on the funds raised from this tournament to allow our students to compete. Schools will be contacted by October 1 if payment has not been received. If payment is not received by October 15 and the school sponsor is not responding to payment inquiries, we will reach out to your campus principal. There are a few rooms that are difficult to find: Any 800 room is a bit of a mystery because the 800 \"hall\" is spread across the campus and tucked away into corners. Students in Grapevine Classic T-Shirts will be able to help you find these rooms. Some rounds are taking place in the Library. These should show up on the pairing as \"Library: Name of Room\" (Example - Library: Grapevine - this is a breakout room labeled \"Grapevine\" in the library). 400 has two entrances but all competitors and judges will need to use the entrance in the 200 hall. If you're assigned a room in the 500 hall, there has been a major glitch in the matrix because there is no 500 hall. Maps will be available and, again, please feel free to ask a student in a Grapevine Classic shirt where to find your room! We are always happy to help. Help us honor our teachers! Everyone who has hosted knows it's a big ask to everyone who works on that campus. We rely on the support and patience of our administrators and educators. We are using darn near every room we have on campus for this tournament and so we need your help to communicate expectations to students and judges alike. First and foremost - no one should ever sit at a teacher's desk or take anything off of their desk! A teacher's desk is a sacred space. I don't care how fun you think it would be to sit at their desk or how comfy their chair is - leave the teacher's desk space alone. Next, please avoid unplugging items in classrooms. Last year, a teacher's fridge with their food for the upcoming week was unplugged and they came back on Monday to spoiled food. This is exactly what we don't want to happen. Please do not unplug fridges, smart boards, etc. We know that speech tournaments require digital devices - but don't wreak havoc in your quest for a power source! Do not remove anything from a classroom. Don't snatch an expo marker. Don't keep a wet floor sign as a souvenir. Don't steal pens off a teacher's desk (throwing that in there again). Don't decide you like the smell of their air freshener and decide to take it to your house. We want to honor and respect the space so we can continue to host in future years. Please also pick up after yourselves and throw away any trash. We appreciate your support with this! Thank you for choosing the Grapevine Classic. Seriously- there are so many tournaments scheduled throughout the year. I know the tournament is early in the season, but we are truly grateful you chose to come to our campus. We love getting the opportunity to host you all! I always reflect on the event and see how we can make it a better experience for everyone involved the next year. Know that providing a quality experience to you will always be our first priority. I am going through my emails to make sure nothing has gotten lost. If I have left you on read, please send me a follow-up. I want to make sure I have answered any questions or concerns and you feel confident going into the tournament!

So please - read and read carefully. :) Remember - all ballots will be assigned and submitted through Tabroom. Please remember to bring a device such as a laptop or tablet (AND A CHARGER) with you. For those of you judging on Friday: You will enter through the main entrance of Grapevine High School. The address is 3223 Mustang Drive, Grapevine, TX 76051. There will be signage and students to help direct you to the right place. We ask that you arrive and check in 30 minutes before your round. Wondering if you're judging on Friday? If you are a school judge, your commitment should have been communicated through the school you are judging for. If you are a hired judge - we used the availability you communicated to us through the hired form unless there were any changes to availability that were communicated via email and confirmed by either Dave Huston or Stef Cambra. What about judging Saturday? Or Sunday? Again - if you're a school-assigned judge, be sure you have communicated with them and know when you are required to be around. Judges who do not show up to a round based on their availability that was entered by their school sponsor will cause the school to get fined. It also helps to know what pool you're judging. If you are in the Congress pool - that is Friday afternoon and evening, as well as Saturday morning. If you are in the Individual Events/Speech pool - this is Saturday only. If you are committed to judge Congress and IEs, then you'll be hanging with us Mustangs for Friday and Saturday. Some of you may be in the pool for debate Friday-Sunday. Some of you may be in the pool for Friday-Saturday or even just Saturday. It's important you double-check with your school's coach or, if you're a hired judge, what you put down as your availability on your Google form. We don't want any surprises of \"we thought you would judge this final round but you aren't here\". Those always make us sad. Again, we ask that you check in 30 minutes before the first round. Not sure when rounds begin? Schedules are posted on our tabroom page! Judge check-in will be in front of the auditorium on Friday and Saturday at Grapevine High School. All judges should check in each day. Hired judges will need to fill out the W9 and contract sheet. Our wonderful Soumya will be at check-in and will review your sheet for any missing information or clarify any handwriting that may be difficult to read to ensure there are no holdups that would prevent you from getting paid in a timely fashion. After you have checked in, you can make your way to hospitality. Where is hospitality? I'm so glad you asked! Keep reading!

Our booster parents work hard to make sure we have a variety of food and drink to keep you happy and fed throughout the tournament weekend. All Friday and Sunday competition will take place at Grapevine High School. Individual Events and Congress Finals will take place at Cross Timbers Middle School on Saturday. The Middle school shares a parking lot with Grapevine High School. Please be sure you know which school you should be at! Judges in the Congress and Speech Pool will go to the library at Cross Timbers Middle School to check in on Saturday. Provide meaningful feedback. Students work so incredibly hard to participate in this activity. It's possible you will judge a student who is attending their first-ever tournament and they are scared out of their minds. It's possible you will judge a student who has competed for four years and has earned state and national awards. No matter what, it is imperative that you are supportive in your feedback. Give students thoughts on how they can improve; celebrate what they do well. Be sure you review your comments to ensure that you do not come across as rude or inappropriate. Please also remember that this activity seeks to provide a platform for students to find their voice and share their perspectives, as well as engage in different viewpoints and develop unique arguments. Challenge your internal biases to judge a student on the quality of their work and not whether or not their content vibes with your own opinions.

Don't decide you like the smell of their air freshener and decide to take it to your house. We want to honor and respect the space so we can continue to host in future years. Please also pick up after yourselves and throw away any trash. We appreciate your support with this! Thank you for judging at the Grapevine Classic. Seriously- there are so many tournaments scheduled throughout the year. I am beyond grateful you have committed your time to support incredible students and a life-changing activity. We love getting the opportunity to host you all! I always reflect on the event and see how we can make it a better experience for everyone involved the next year. Know that providing a quality experience to you will always be our first priority. I am going through my emails to make sure nothing has gotten lost. If I have left you on read, please send me a follow-up. I want to make sure I have answered any questions or concerns and you feel confident going into the tournament!

PF teams have 3 minutes of prep time in accordance with NSDA rules. I have updated the default prep timer on Tabroom in order to clarify this. It is not 4 minutes of prep. Teams that ask for 4 minutes of prep are wrong. PF flights, including setup, evidence exchange, prep time, and an RFD, should take no longer than 1 hour. Judges and competitors should be at the room 10 minutes before their debate is scheduled to begin. Especially as we get later into the evening and the rounds become higher stakes, you must report to your round on time. As we get into elimination rounds, teams who are not prepared to begin debating at the round start time will risk forfeiting the debate, and judges who are not present at the round start time will risk their program being fined or their pay being docked. Judges -- please submit your decision and speaker points first and edit feedback on your ballot later. We need your decision, speaker points and ranks to pair the next round.

We appreciate your willingness to help us get rounds started. As we get ready to start elim rounds, we need your assistance to help make the tournament continue to go!!! 1. Judge Obligations: Each judge is obligated one round past the elimination of the last student from the school that you are judging for, regardless of any other affiliations you might have this weekend. That means EVERY JUDGE is obligated through at least Double Octafinals (the first full elimination round)!!! 2. Tabroom Blast & Arrival Time: Please do not solely rely on text blasts to receive your pairings. We have been made aware that text functions have been somewhat unreliable. Always double check your pairing on tabroom. \"I didn't see the my name\" or \"I didn't get a text blast\" is not an acceptable reason for not showing up on time. Judges that are not in the room 10minutes prior to the start of the round are subject to being replaced and fined with no other warning. 3. Coin Flips: We will be using the auto coin flip feature in Tabroom for the elimination rounds and will follow the following protocol. Debaters should immediately report to the room when the pairings come out in order to engage in disclosure and pre round discussion before the flip. The flip will occur 3 minutes after the posting of the pairing and each side should verify the flip on their tabroom dashboard to help with some of the issues with text blasts this weekend.

If you do not report to the room to verify the flip and participate in this process the team in attendance will pick the side, no matter the results of the tabroom flip. 4. Competitors must be in the room no later than 10minutes before the start of their flight. Start times are not suggestions and will be strictly enforced. If a student is not in the room at the designated start time, you risk forfeit. 5. SUNDAY REMINDERS: There will be Sunday rounds (as promised in the invite). If you are obligated to judge, you must show up. If you are willing to judge additional Sunday rounds, please let us know and we would be happy to work that out with you.

Thank you again for judging at the Grapevine Classic. I wanted to send out one big update email to avoid any individual emails I may have missed. First - if you were a school judge or a volunteer judge you can stop reading and go on with your day. Thank you for your support of our community! Second - if you were a hired judge...keep reading. I believe that the vast majority of judge checks should have been received this past week. Based on the update I received from Donna Gunn, all checks for those who turned in paperwork at the tournament were mailed on Friday, October 6. Those who emailed their paperwork after the tournament (such as those who completed virtual rounds on Monday) are still being processed but you should receive payment soon! Donna is an amazing finance person - but she is just one person who is currently also training her replacement to take over when she retires. She handles every single check for every single activity at the high school and the district process of getting judges into the system and then requesting checks to be cut can take a little bit of time. So I want to thank you for your patience. If you turned in your physical judge paperwork at the tournament and have not yet received payment, please email myself at stephanie.cambra@rcisd.org and Donna Gunn at donna.gunn@gcisd.net and we will very quickly look into it. I will send out another email when those who submitted paperwork digitally should receive their checks.

I will be flowing all your speeches and will make my decision based on the flow, with as little intervention as possible. If you want me to vote off something that happened in cross, you must bring it up in a speech. Evidence is super important; please read cut cards, and if your opponents ask you for evidence you must be able to send the fully cut card (not just a URL!) to the email chain. Keep track of your own prep time. In speeches, I'll stop flowing at 5 seconds over if you're finishing a thought but if you start a new response overtime I won't flow it. Don't be unnecessarily rude, I'll tank your speaks. I do love some snark tho; you don\u2019t always have to be nice in debate. Racism/sexism/homophobia/ableism/etc will not be tolerated and will result in an auto L.</p>\n<p>Please send speech docs with cut cards before your speech!!!!!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>SUBSTANCE DEBATE TAKES I HAVE:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Defense is not sticky</strong> \u2013 you must extend all defense that you want to matter for my ballot, even if it was conceded, in the first summary. Additionally, second rebuttal has to frontline and objectively, from a strategic standpoint, should frontline before it attacks the opponent's case.</p>\n<p><strong>Weighing</strong>\u2013 make your weighing comparitive and warranted, and you must respond to your opponent's weighing and explain why yours is better. I cannot emphasize this enough. Weighing preferences: Say probability instead of strength of link. Saying you outweigh on probability because the argument was conceded is stupid- think of some real warrants. Outweighing on timeframe isn't just \"our impact happens now, theirs happens in 10 years\" - you need to implicate this claim, ie the solution to their impact doesn't have to be the aff (intervening actors solve). Tbh, I think metaweighing is stupid 99% of the time- a better strat when trying to win a weighing debate is to match all their mechs/respond to them, and use your extra mechanisms to \"break the tie\". Weighing should start in 2nd rebuttal and the last place where new weighing is ok is 1st final (already kinda cheeky\u2013 don't read 4 new mechs, it has to build off of summary's weighing)</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions</strong> \u2013 Extend uq/link/IL/impact of the argument you are going for. My link/impact extension threshold is relatively low, but warrants do still have to exist. I personally don't think you have to extend case in second rebuttal\u2013 extensions should start in the summaries. Additionally, you should never go for both contentions, or both links of one contention, it's a waste of your time. Go for one piece of case offense, and 1-2 pieces of turn offense. Or just go for turns</p>\n<p><strong>Framework</strong>\u2013 Framework is great when done correctly; otherwise, it's a massive waste of everyone's time. For example, DO NOT read cost-benefit analysis framework\u2013 framework is meant to frame your opponents out of the debate. Reading the implicit, universal rules of a debate round as your framework is not strategic at all. Additionally, if you are reading SV framework, you should probably make the the warrants for the framework specific to the group you are impacting to (women, indigenous people, etc). Otherwise, you allow the opponent to get away with some very sketchy link-ins which defeats the purpose of framework. PF is having this stupid trend of kids spending 15 seconds reading \"fRamEwOrK\" that essentially says \"SV is bad, vote ___ to break the cycle\"\u2013 this is not what good framework looks like. There should be several, smart warrants for why your framework is important as well as a clear ROTB with warrants as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Evidence comparison</strong>\u2013 do it. post-date, empirical, meta-study, greater sample size, etc. Please don't make me intervene when there's two competing claims/warrants just sitting there on the flow\u2013 evidence comparison is key in these scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong>\u2013 When done well, I love it. I think it allows for more interesting, technical debates with more clash. However, if you can't spread, DON'T DO IT. I will not flow off your doc. Your speaker points will suffer. You can still win rounds with efficiency + good word economy; please please don't try to go fast if it sacrifices your clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Off-time roadmaps</strong>\u2013 Most of the time these are goofy. Just tell me where you are starting and sign-post from there. If there are three sheets or more then please tell me the order of the sheets but that\u2019s lowk it</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>PROGRESSIVE DEBATE TAKES I HAVE:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theory</strong></p>\n<p>I default to competing interps, but essentially I'll just evaluate the flow (not much different than evaling a substance round)</p>\n<p>Theory must be read in the speech right after the violation</p>\n<p>Out of the shells you could read I will probably be most receptive to paraphrasing and disclosure theory, I have some experience reading these arguments, although not a ton\u2013 send the shell to the email chain before you read it. Also stop forgetting to extend drop the debater in the backhalf</p>\n<p>PF doesn't seem to understand what an RVI is, so if you want to read a shell know that <strong>THIS IS WHAT I CONSIDER AN RVI:</strong> All we need to prove is that we don't violate to win this round (ie similar to winning off of defense). HOWEVER, if the responding team concedes no RVIs that DOES NOT MEAN THE SHELL IS CONCEDED. If the responding team wins offense on the shell (ie a counter-interp) they can still win the round. This argument is very simple and I don't understand why there is such confusion surrounding this issue. It's just like a normal round - if you win a turn on your opponent's case, that is a voting issue for you.</p>\n<p>Some random preferences that may be useful to you: Don't read a para good counter-interp, I will not vote for frivolous theory, I'm generally skewed towards trigger warnings bad, I think round reports are ultra dumb</p>\n<p>EDIT: Theory is done so poorly in PF 99.99% of the time and it's honestly painful to watch/endure sometimes. I cannot promise you your speaks won't be dookie if you read theory. That said, do what you need to do to win, but I would probably advise against reading theory in prelims if I'm your judge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Kritiks</strong></p>\n<p>I have some experience reading and/or debating set col, security, fem, and cap, so those are for sure the three I would feel most confident evaluating. However, just generally run Ks at your own risk with me, I don't know much about most of the lit</p>\n<p>Stop running Ks without an alt or reading very goofy alts\u2013 please read an actual alt that YOU UNDERSTAND + CAN EXPLAIN. If your opponent asks you \"what is the alt\" / \"how does the alt solve for the harm\" / \"what is the role of the neg/aff in this debate\", and you can't respond without opening your speech doc and word-vomiting policy backfiles, rethink the strat.</p>\n<p>Similar to theory debates, I believe K debate extensions should be done off the doc - that\u2019s what I did all throughout my career and I believe it makes things a lot more consistent. If you\u2019re paraphrasing your ROTB and alt differently every speech it could potentially make you a moving target and make your argument a lot more vulnerable to responses. I feel like it also just makes the debate more efficient, especially if the argument is new to you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>IVIs</strong></p>\n<p>Literally just no</p>\n<p>There are structures and mechanisms in place for you to deal with in-round abuses, DO NOT read a 10 second blip with horrific warranting and expect me to vote on it. Read theory or call a violation with tab</p>\n<p>If you are going to read an IVI, I'll feel comfortable voting on any RVIs read against it + evaluate it through reasonability</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>FOR NOVICES:</strong></p>\n<p>TLDR: TO MASSIVELY INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING THIS DEBATE, EXTEND ONE OF YOUR CONTENTIONS AND WEIGH IT. Like 70% of novice rounds are won by simply doing this.</p>\n<p>Some things I would like to see in round:</p>\n<p>1. Every speech after constructives must answer the speech that came before it. For example, in second rebuttal you must respond to the responses the other team put on your case (as well as respond to their case). Also, <br/>\"sticky defense\" is not a thing- defense must be extended in first summary for it to matter.</p>\n<p>2. Please weigh your arguments! Magnitude, probability, Prerequisite, etc. and give a reason why your argument outweighs. If you just say \"we outweigh on magnitude\" and move on without comparing the impacts and actually explaining why, I can't really evaluate it. Also, make sure to respond to your opponent's weighing, otherwise I'm forced to intervene.</p>\n<p>3. In summary and final focus, extend the links/warrants/impact(s) of the arguments you're going for. If you just say \"extend Russia\" and don't explain what \"Russia\" is, I can't vote on it. My link/impact extension threshold is relatively low, but warrants+internal links do still have to exist.</p>\n<p>4. Please narrow down the back half of the debate! Y'all should really only be going for one contention from case, and don't try to extend every response from rebuttal in summary/final focus. Choose a couple you think are the strongest and you are winning the most, and explain those+weigh them well. In summary you should probably be collapsing on 2-3 pieces of offense (arguments that give me a reason to vote for you, like case or turns) and in final focus you should probably be collapsing on 1-2.</p>\n<p>5. Last speech where new arguments are okay is first final focus, and that's just for new weighing (and it should be building off of summary's weighing, not like 3 completely new mechs)</p>\n<p>6.

Additionally, second rebuttal has to frontline and objectively, from a strategic standpoint, should frontline before it attacks the opponent's case.\nWeighing\u2013 make your weighing comparitive and warranted, and you must respond to your opponent's weighing and explain why yours is better. I cannot emphasize this enough. Weighing preferences: Say probability instead of strength of link. Saying you outweigh on probability because the argument was conceded is stupid- think of some real warrants. Outweighing on timeframe isn't just \"our impact happens now, theirs happens in 10 years\" - you need to implicate this claim, ie the solution to their impact doesn't have to be the aff (intervening actors solve). Tbh, I think metaweighing is stupid 99% of the time- a better strat when trying to win a weighing debate is to match all their mechs/respond to them, and use your extra mechanisms to \"break the tie\". Weighing should start in 2nd rebuttal and the last place where new weighing is ok is 1st final (already kinda cheeky\u2013 don't read 4 new mechs, it has to build off of summary's weighing)\nExtensions \u2013 Extend uq/link/IL/impact of the argument you are going for. My link/impact extension threshold is relatively low, but warrants do still have to exist. I personally don't think you have to extend case in second rebuttal\u2013 extensions should start in the summaries. Additionally, you should never go for both contentions, or both links of one contention, it's a waste of your time. Go for one piece of case offense, and 1-2 pieces of turn offense. Or just go for turns\nFramework\u2013 Framework is great when done correctly; otherwise, it's a massive waste of everyone's time. For example, DO NOT read cost-benefit analysis framework\u2013 framework is meant to frame your opponents out of the debate. Reading the implicit, universal rules of a debate round as your framework is not strategic at all. Additionally, if you are reading SV framework, you should probably make the the warrants for the framework specific to the group you are impacting to (women, indigenous people, etc). Otherwise, you allow the opponent to get away with some very sketchy link-ins which defeats the purpose of framework. PF is having this stupid trend of kids spending 15 seconds reading \"fRamEwOrK\" that essentially says \"SV is bad, vote ___ to break the cycle\"\u2013 this is not what good framework looks like. There should be several, smart warrants for why your framework is important as well as a clear ROTB with warrants as well.\nEvidence comparison\u2013 do it. post-date, empirical, meta-study, greater sample size, etc. Please don't make me intervene when there's two competing claims/warrants just sitting there on the flow\u2013 evidence comparison is key in these scenarios.\nSpeed\u2013 When done well, I love it. I think it allows for more interesting, technical debates with more clash. However, if you can't spread, DON'T DO IT. I will not flow off your doc. Your speaker points will suffer. You can still win rounds with efficiency + good word economy; please please don't try to go fast if it sacrifices your clarity.\nOff-time roadmaps\u2013 Most of the time these are goofy. Just tell me where you are starting and sign-post from there. If there are three sheets or more then please tell me the order of the sheets but that\u2019s lowk it\n\nPROGRESSIVE DEBATE TAKES I HAVE:\nTheory\nI default to competing interps, but essentially I'll just evaluate the flow (not much different than evaling a substance round)\nTheory must be read in the speech right after the violation\nOut of the shells you could read I will probably be most receptive to paraphrasing and disclosure theory, I have some experience reading these arguments, although not a ton\u2013 send the shell to the email chain before you read it. Also stop forgetting to extend drop the debater in the backhalf\nPF doesn't seem to understand what an RVI is, so if you want to read a shell know that THIS IS WHAT I CONSIDER AN RVI: All we need to prove is that we don't violate to win this round (ie similar to winning off of defense). HOWEVER, if the responding team concedes no RVIs that DOES NOT MEAN THE SHELL IS CONCEDED. If the responding team wins offense on the shell (ie a counter-interp) they can still win the round. This argument is very simple and I don't understand why there is such confusion surrounding this issue. It's just like a normal round - if you win a turn on your opponent's case, that is a voting issue for you.\nSome random preferences that may be useful to you: Don't read a para good counter-interp, I will not vote for frivolous theory, I'm generally skewed towards trigger warnings bad, I think round reports are ultra dumb\nEDIT: Theory is done so poorly in PF 99.99% of the time and it's honestly painful to watch/endure sometimes. I cannot promise you your speaks won't be dookie if you read theory. That said, do what you need to do to win, but I would probably advise against reading theory in prelims if I'm your judge.\n\nKritiks\nI have some experience reading and/or debating set col, security, fem, and cap, so those are for sure the three I would feel most confident evaluating. However, just generally run Ks at your own risk with me, I don't know much about most of the lit\nStop running Ks without an alt or reading very goofy alts\u2013 please read an actual alt that YOU UNDERSTAND + CAN EXPLAIN. If your opponent asks you \"what is the alt\" / \"how does the alt solve for the harm\" / \"what is the role of the neg/aff in this debate\", and you can't respond without opening your speech doc and word-vomiting policy backfiles, rethink the strat.\nSimilar to theory debates, I believe K debate extensions should be done off the doc - that\u2019s what I did all throughout my career and I believe it makes things a lot more consistent. If you\u2019re paraphrasing your ROTB and alt differently every speech it could potentially make you a moving target and make your argument a lot more vulnerable to responses. I feel like it also just makes the debate more efficient, especially if the argument is new to you.\n\nIVIs\nLiterally just no\nThere are structures and mechanisms in place for you to deal with in-round abuses, DO NOT read a 10 second blip with horrific warranting and expect me to vote on it. Read theory or call a violation with tab\nIf you are going to read an IVI, I'll feel comfortable voting on any RVIs read against it + evaluate it through reasonability\n\nFOR NOVICES:\nTLDR: TO MASSIVELY INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING THIS DEBATE, EXTEND ONE OF YOUR CONTENTIONS AND WEIGH IT. Like 70% of novice rounds are won by simply doing this.\nSome things I would like to see in round:\n1. Every speech after constructives must answer the speech that came before it. For example, in second rebuttal you must respond to the responses the other team put on your case (as well as respond to their case). Also, \"sticky defense\" is not a thing- defense must be extended in first summary for it to matter.\n2. Please weigh your arguments! Magnitude, probability, Prerequisite, etc. and give a reason why your argument outweighs. If you just say \"we outweigh on magnitude\" and move on without comparing the impacts and actually explaining why, I can't really evaluate it. Also, make sure to respond to your opponent's weighing, otherwise I'm forced to intervene.\n3. In summary and final focus, extend the links/warrants/impact(s) of the arguments you're going for. If you just say \"extend Russia\" and don't explain what \"Russia\" is, I can't vote on it. My link/impact extension threshold is relatively low, but warrants+internal links do still have to exist.\n4. Please narrow down the back half of the debate! Y'all should really only be going for one contention from case, and don't try to extend every response from rebuttal in summary/final focus. Choose a couple you think are the strongest and you are winning the most, and explain those+weigh them well. In summary you should probably be collapsing on 2-3 pieces of offense (arguments that give me a reason to vote for you, like case or turns) and in final focus you should probably be collapsing on 1-2.\n5. Last speech where new arguments are okay is first final focus, and that's just for new weighing (and it should be building off of summary's weighing, not like 3 completely new mechs)\n6. Please signpost, order, and label your arguments!!!\n\nMISCELLANEOUS:\nMy goddesses: ELIZ and TRONK\nstay clippin\n\nMost importantly, don't stress and have fun!

Spark and other hypothetical impact turns are fine.</p>\n<p>- Do not use racist/sexist/misogynistic rhetoric.</p>\n<p>- I will \"flow\" cross-examination and it is binding (it exists for a reason). I hate it when teams don't understand their own arguments and this is the time to make it obvious. Probably won't be a voting issue but could be made into one.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Preferables\"</strong> (your speaks will automatically improve but I won't hold it against you unless convinced otherwise by theory etc.) <strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>- Disclose previously broken positions on the wiki (personally think new Affs/Negs are good but that is a debate to be had)</p>\n<p>- Read from cut cards</p>\n<p>- Send constructive and rebuttal docs with all the cards <strong>before </strong>your speech. I will <strong>never </strong>call for specific evidence after the round. If I think the evidence will decide or influence my decision I will go to speech docs to read it, if it isn't there too bad. Sending evidence after the round is just a way for debaters to send new evidence they didn't read, highlight evidence, cut parts out - I don't want to deal with that. TLDR: It helps both you and the debate if you send docs. I am a sucker for good evidence. If you have some really good evidence make sure I know about it - call it out by name. Again not an excuse for not debating - don't hide behind your evidence.</p>\n<p>- Pre-flow before the round.</p>\n<p><strong>General: </strong></p>\n<p>- Tech &gt; Truth (to an extent) - if an argument is dropped it is considered true but still has to be an argument for you to win on it (ie. it must be extended with uniqueness/link/internal link/impact), new implications or cross applications justify new responses to the specific implication. If you blow up a 2-second rebuttal blip - my threshold for responses won't be very high. More stuff on progressive arguments later.</p>\n<p>- Read whatever you want to read - do your own thing. More on specific progressive arguments later.</p>\n<p>- Open CX is fine (both people can speak/explain during cross-examination). Flex prep is fine and often good (ask questions during your prep time).</p>\n<p>- 2nd rebuttal should collapse and frontline everything on the argument you're going for. Efficiency will be rewarded with good speaks. Defense is <strong>not </strong>sticky. Most \"weighing\" is new responses more on that later - at the latest 1st final but that's probably way too late and justifies 2nd final responses which isn't good for you anyway. 0 risk is a thing, but most defense will be evaluated on a probabilistic scale. 1st summary is the <strong>last </strong>time, I will flow new arguments. (There is a distinction between new arguments and new weighing - be careful.)</p>\n<p>- Most substantive questions will be revealed on a probabilistic scale - comparative risk of the arguments. In 99% of debates, both sides will win some offense so comparative weighing and impact calculus can and often decides rounds. Procedural arguments often have to be evaluated on a yes/no basis (does the AFF violate the interp, RVIs or no RVIs, etc.)</p>\n<p>- Turns. I love them but they are often done terribly. 99% of link turns need uniqueness to be offensive (ie. If the AFF tells me there is no negotiation in the status quo, and the NEG goes for a link turn about how the AFF makes negotiation worse, I have no idea what the impact to negative negotiation is.) Impact turns are also often interesting debates - if the link is contested (I hope it isn't if you're going for an impact turn) or if your opponents go for a different argument, then extend it clearly. If both teams seem to agree to the link and it just becomes an impact debate, I don't really care about link extensions too much. There are only 2 types of turns. Link turns and impact turns. New DAs and ADVs are often labeled as turns but you won't fool me and don't try - more on that later.</p>\n<p>- Weighing. Also something I love but is often done wrong. There are three weighing mechanisms: probability, timeframe, and magnitude. Any other mechanism is either a subset of those three (ie. scope is a subset of magnitude) or isn't a weighing mechanism (ie. clarity of the strength of the link or whatever people like to say.) Unless convinced otherwise (which is easily possible), <strong>link weighing/debating &gt; impact weighing.</strong> I often find that nuclear war outweighs climate change or poverty outweighs death is irrelevant with good link weighing. <strong>I will give examples of link weighing below: at the latest these arguments need to be introduced by 1st summary. </strong> Probability link weighing are no-link <strong>arguments</strong> or \"mitigatory defense.\" Stuff like \"it is hard for terrorists to get BMDs because of monetary and technical constraints\" is definitely link defense and needs to be in 1st summary at the latest. Probability is a function of how much defense you win on an argument, I will not arbitrarily assign probabilities (ie. say climate change is more probable than nuclear war) - you have to explain to me why that is the case which often is just link defense. Timeframe link weighing can be great. Arguments like the NATO bank at the earliest even if created won't get funding for years etc. Magnitude link weighing is really good and often underused (ie. \"scope of solvency\"). Solving bitcoin emissions won't solve climate change writ large etc. That being said, I can be convinced that impact weighing comes before link weighing. Arguments like extinction first and Bostrom and viable and can also be good. I hope everyone knows what impact weighing is so not going to go too in-depth on that. Last note - turns case is really, really good and also really, really underutilized in PF. Conflict probably ends negotiations, climate change probably makes war more likely, economic growth probably resolves underlying conditions for crime, etc. These types of arguments can really help you frame a round and establish why your came case comes first. Impact weighing and turns case can come by 1st final by the latest.</p>\n<p>- Try or die can be convincing if done well. It is often a great strategy if you are going for an extinction impact and the NEG has conceded uniqueness. This is not an excuse for not frontlining - 0 risk is a thing. <strong>Timeframe </strong>is a really good weighing mechanism in try or die/extinction first debates and can often implicate probablity.</p>\n<p>- Framing debates are also really interesting - extinction first etc. Framing arguments are <strong>not</strong> a substitute for link debate but a supplement. If you win policy paralysis and the other team wins a very large risk of their extinction scenario, the other team has probably won the round.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Substance\": </strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>Quality &gt; quantity.</strong> Not too many interesting thoughts here. Good weighing and link debating wins rounds - avoiding clash, being shifty, and dumping blips doesn't.</p>\n<p>- Empirics aren't arguments but can help your position combined with warrants. If you have good empirics that are specific to the mechanism of the resolution/your argument you're probably in a good spot.</p>\n<p>- I could <strong>care less</strong> about quantified impacts. They are often random predictions by conspiracy theorists or terrible models. Even worse, debater math. I would much rather your impact be economic growth than some math you did with different studies and percentages. Extinction is an impact, recession is an impact, etc - I do not care about your 900 million card.</p>\n<p>- Kicking case in reading a new DA/ADV in 2nd rebuttal is a <strong>bad idea. </strong>You essentially just wasted half of the debate. I will have a very low threshold for responses and encourage theory. This is <strong>different </strong>from reading 4 minutes of turns (ie. kicking case and just going for prolif good). I am perfectly fine with that, in fact, that would be quite fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Below are some thoughts on progressive argumentation. </strong>Don't read these arguments to win rounds - it's quite obvious. You disclose for the first time and read disclosure theory, change from full text to open source for 1 tournament to meet your interp, etc. I will still vote for it if you win but your speaks won't be great. Also, don't read progressive arguments just to beat novices - I will give you the worst speaks I possibly can.</p>\n<p><strong>Theory: </strong></p>\n<p>- I have mixed feelings on disclosing broken interps - could be convinced either way. In general, meta-theory is interesting and under-used.</p>\n<p>- Topicality is also interesting. Define words in the resolution. Intent to define and evidence quality is extremely important. Unlike most theory debate, precision, your interpretation, and the evidence matter a <strong>lot </strong>more to me than the limits/ground debate.</p>\n<p>- While I will not \"hack\" against these arguments be aware it is an uphill battle if you are defending paraphrasing good or disclosure bad. If you win your CI and everything on the flow of course I will still vote for you. If it is a close-round, you know which way I am probably going to vote.</p>\n<p>- I default to competing interpretations, no RVIs, spirit of the interp, and drop the debater. I can easily be convinced otherwise. If paradigm issues are dropped/agreed upon they do not need to be extended in every speech. If the debate devolves to just theory under competing interps - I am voting for the better model of debate, I could not care that you won no RVIs (personally, no RVIs doesn't mean you can't win on a counter-interp in my mind)</p>\n<p>- Reasonability is a good tool against mis-disclosure (open-source versus full text etc) and frivolous shells. <strong>You should still read a counter interp</strong> - but explain why the marginal differences in your models of debate are outweighed by substance crowd out etc.</p>\n<p>- Read your shell the speech after the violation (if they paraphrase in 2nd rebuttal - <strong>feel free </strong>to read paraphrasing theory in 1st summary.) Theory after that is fairly late and really hard to have good clash, thus probably will result in intervention but if you think its necessary read it (bad language etc.)</p>\n<p>- For some reason, small school counter-interps are quite popular and I get why (I read them myself a few times.) <strong>However, </strong>I am inclined to believe that arbitrary entry limits are just that <strong>arbitrary</strong>. Also, a lot of small schools are in big prep groups with a lot of resources, or just don't have a lot of people competing etc.</p>\n<p>- Theory is unaccessible is a <strong>terrible argument </strong> - there are tons of resources out there and if you need more help/advice feel free to email me.

I love the activity and know how much time you put in - you deserve a judge that pays attention and that cares. Go as fast as you want but be clear. More often than not you don't need to read 4 contentions or go as fast are you're going - quality is way more important than quality.\nSpeaks are a function of strategy (good collapsing, weighing, going for dropped turns and doing it well, etc) and practices (disclosure, cut cards, etc). I do not care what you wear. Speaks will range from 28 to 30 unless you do something unacceptable.\nI will research most, if not all, of the topics. So, you can assume I have background knowledge, but if you're reading something super specific explain it and your acronyms.\nSmart analytics > bad evidence or paraphrased blips.\nIf you want a short version - I agree with Akhil Bhale.\nNon-negotiables:\n- No prep stealing (it's quite obvious)\n- Have the cut card for any piece of evidence that you read easily accessible (bare minimum), if your going to send links to large PDFs please strike me.\n- I am uninterested in listening to and will not vote for arguments that endorse self-harm or suicide. Spark and other hypothetical impact turns are fine.\n- Do not use racist/sexist/misogynistic rhetoric.\n- I will \"flow\" cross-examination and it is binding (it exists for a reason). I hate it when teams don't understand their own arguments and this is the time to make it obvious. Probably won't be a voting issue but could be made into one.\n\"Preferables\" (your speaks will automatically improve but I won't hold it against you unless convinced otherwise by theory etc.) :\n- Disclose previously broken positions on the wiki (personally think new Affs/Negs are good but that is a debate to be had)\n- Read from cut cards\n- Send constructive and rebuttal docs with all the cards before your speech. I will never call for specific evidence after the round. If I think the evidence will decide or influence my decision I will go to speech docs to read it, if it isn't there too bad. Sending evidence after the round is just a way for debaters to send new evidence they didn't read, highlight evidence, cut parts out - I don't want to deal with that. TLDR: It helps both you and the debate if you send docs. I am a sucker for good evidence. If you have some really good evidence make sure I know about it - call it out by name. Again not an excuse for not debating - don't hide behind your evidence.\n- Pre-flow before the round.\nGeneral: \n- Tech > Truth (to an extent) - if an argument is dropped it is considered true but still has to be an argument for you to win on it (ie. it must be extended with uniqueness/link/internal link/impact), new implications or cross applications justify new responses to the specific implication. If you blow up a 2-second rebuttal blip - my threshold for responses won't be very high. More stuff on progressive arguments later.\n- Read whatever you want to read - do your own thing. More on specific progressive arguments later.\n- Open CX is fine (both people can speak/explain during cross-examination). Flex prep is fine and often good (ask questions during your prep time).\n- 2nd rebuttal should collapse and frontline everything on the argument you're going for. Efficiency will be rewarded with good speaks. Defense is not sticky. Most \"weighing\" is new responses more on that later - at the latest 1st final but that's probably way too late and justifies 2nd final responses which isn't good for you anyway. 0 risk is a thing, but most defense will be evaluated on a probabilistic scale. 1st summary is the last time, I will flow new arguments. (There is a distinction between new arguments and new weighing - be careful.)\n- Most substantive questions will be revealed on a probabilistic scale - comparative risk of the arguments. In 99% of debates, both sides will win some offense so comparative weighing and impact calculus can and often decides rounds. Procedural arguments often have to be evaluated on a yes/no basis (does the AFF violate the interp, RVIs or no RVIs, etc.)\n- Turns. I love them but they are often done terribly. 99% of link turns need uniqueness to be offensive (ie. If the AFF tells me there is no negotiation in the status quo, and the NEG goes for a link turn about how the AFF makes negotiation worse, I have no idea what the impact to negative negotiation is.) Impact turns are also often interesting debates - if the link is contested (I hope it isn't if you're going for an impact turn) or if your opponents go for a different argument, then extend it clearly. If both teams seem to agree to the link and it just becomes an impact debate, I don't really care about link extensions too much. There are only 2 types of turns. Link turns and impact turns. New DAs and ADVs are often labeled as turns but you won't fool me and don't try - more on that later.\n- Weighing. Also something I love but is often done wrong. There are three weighing mechanisms: probability, timeframe, and magnitude. Any other mechanism is either a subset of those three (ie. scope is a subset of magnitude) or isn't a weighing mechanism (ie. clarity of the strength of the link or whatever people like to say.) Unless convinced otherwise (which is easily possible), link weighing/debating > impact weighing. I often find that nuclear war outweighs climate change or poverty outweighs death is irrelevant with good link weighing. I will give examples of link weighing below: at the latest these arguments need to be introduced by 1st summary.  Probability link weighing are no-link arguments or \"mitigatory defense.\" Stuff like \"it is hard for terrorists to get BMDs because of monetary and technical constraints\" is definitely link defense and needs to be in 1st summary at the latest. Probability is a function of how much defense you win on an argument, I will not arbitrarily assign probabilities (ie. say climate change is more probable than nuclear war) - you have to explain to me why that is the case which often is just link defense. Timeframe link weighing can be great. Arguments like the NATO bank at the earliest even if created won't get funding for years etc. Magnitude link weighing is really good and often underused (ie. \"scope of solvency\"). Solving bitcoin emissions won't solve climate change writ large etc. That being said, I can be convinced that impact weighing comes before link weighing. Arguments like extinction first and Bostrom and viable and can also be good. I hope everyone knows what impact weighing is so not going to go too in-depth on that. Last note - turns case is really, really good and also really, really underutilized in PF. Conflict probably ends negotiations, climate change probably makes war more likely, economic growth probably resolves underlying conditions for crime, etc. These types of arguments can really help you frame a round and establish why your came case comes first. Impact weighing and turns case can come by 1st final by the latest.\n- Try or die can be convincing if done well. It is often a great strategy if you are going for an extinction impact and the NEG has conceded uniqueness. This is not an excuse for not frontlining - 0 risk is a thing. Timeframe is a really good weighing mechanism in try or die/extinction first debates and can often implicate probablity.\n- Framing debates are also really interesting - extinction first etc. Framing arguments are not a substitute for link debate but a supplement. If you win policy paralysis and the other team wins a very large risk of their extinction scenario, the other team has probably won the round.\n\"Substance\": \n- Quality > quantity. Not too many interesting thoughts here. Good weighing and link debating wins rounds - avoiding clash, being shifty, and dumping blips doesn't.\n- Empirics aren't arguments but can help your position combined with warrants. If you have good empirics that are specific to the mechanism of the resolution/your argument you're probably in a good spot.\n- I could care less about quantified impacts. They are often random predictions by conspiracy theorists or terrible models. Even worse, debater math. I would much rather your impact be economic growth than some math you did with different studies and percentages. Extinction is an impact, recession is an impact, etc - I do not care about your 900 million card.\n- Kicking case in reading a new DA/ADV in 2nd rebuttal is a bad idea. You essentially just wasted half of the debate. I will have a very low threshold for responses and encourage theory. This is different from reading 4 minutes of turns (ie. kicking case and just going for prolif good). I am perfectly fine with that, in fact, that would be quite fun.\nBelow are some thoughts on progressive argumentation. Don't read these arguments to win rounds - it's quite obvious. You disclose for the first time and read disclosure theory, change from full text to open source for 1 tournament to meet your interp, etc. I will still vote for it if you win but your speaks won't be great. Also, don't read progressive arguments just to beat novices - I will give you the worst speaks I possibly can.\nTheory: \n- I have mixed feelings on disclosing broken interps - could be convinced either way. In general, meta-theory is interesting and under-used.\n- Topicality is also interesting. Define words in the resolution. Intent to define and evidence quality is extremely important. Unlike most theory debate, precision, your interpretation, and the evidence matter a lot more to me than the limits/ground debate.\n- While I will not \"hack\" against these arguments be aware it is an uphill battle if you are defending paraphrasing good or disclosure bad. If you win your CI and everything on the flow of course I will still vote for you. If it is a close-round, you know which way I am probably going to vote.\n- I default to competing interpretations, no RVIs, spirit of the interp, and drop the debater. I can easily be convinced otherwise. If paradigm issues are dropped/agreed upon they do not need to be extended in every speech. If the debate devolves to just theory under competing interps - I am voting for the better model of debate, I could not care that you won no RVIs (personally, no RVIs doesn't mean you can't win on a counter-interp in my mind)\n- Reasonability is a good tool against mis-disclosure (open-source versus full text etc) and frivolous shells. You should still read a counter interp - but explain why the marginal differences in your models of debate are outweighed by substance crowd out etc.\n- Read your shell the speech after the violation (if they paraphrase in 2nd rebuttal - feel free to read paraphrasing theory in 1st summary.) Theory after that is fairly late and really hard to have good clash, thus probably will result in intervention but if you think its necessary read it (bad language etc.)\n- For some reason, small school counter-interps are quite popular and I get why (I read them myself a few times.) However, I am inclined to believe that arbitrary entry limits are just that arbitrary. Also, a lot of small schools are in big prep groups with a lot of resources, or just don't have a lot of people competing etc.\n- Theory is unaccessible is a terrible argument  - there are tons of resources out there and if you need more help/advice feel free to email me. It is just like responding to any other argument.\n- Theory cards, in most cases, are overrated and are often just written by former debaters and will be evaluated on the same level as any other standard/argument. This is different from topicality interpretations and impact weighing/cards against Ks.\nK's: \n- \"Substantive Ks\" like Cap K or Security K are great but probably will just be evaluated as DAs or impact turns. Reading it as a K is often just an excuse to get out of the uniqueness debate, and when your alternative is just rejection, I don't think that gets you very far.\n- Non-topical positions are also fine - I am familiar with most of the stuff people read in PF, but if you're reading high-theory or something confusing - slow down and explain it. I won't vote for something I can't explain back to you. This is my one exception to disclosing new Affs/Negs. I strongly believe non-topical positions should be disclosed before the debate to allow for clash.\n- I slightly lean towards T/FW against K affs/negs probably because K debate in PF isn't done very well - but can easily be convinced otherwise.

Weighing is really important in these rounds and I find that the theory teams get away with some stuff too easily (answer stuff like fairness is key to participation which comes before your method.)\n- I am also down for a method v method debate, or PIKs etc. Conditionality is probably good against a new K aff/neg (ie. fine with T/FW combined with a PIK etc)\n- Long pre-written overviews are not as useful as line-by-line and specific weighing.\n- Also, please have an actual method. If you say \"vote for me because I pointed this out,\" you probably won't get my ballot.\n- Paraphrased Ks are a big no. Non-negotiable. \nIf you got this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. If you have any questions feel free to email me whenever.

There are a few things that you need to know to win my ballot:</p>\n<p>The teams who have routinely gotten my ballot have done a great job collapsing the debate down to a few key points. After this, they have compared specific warrants, evidence, and analytics and explained why their arguments are better, why their opponents arguments are worse, and why their arguments being better means they win the debate. This may sound easy, however, it is not. Trust your instincts, debate fearlessly, take chances, and do not worry about whatever facial expression I have. I promise you do not have any idea where my thoughts are.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossfires:</strong> Use this time wisely. Use it to clarify, use it to create ethos, use it to get concessions, use it to make their arguments look bad and yours good. But use it. I think answers given in crossfire are binding in the debate. If you get a big concession use it in your speeches.</p>\n<p><strong>Framework(s):</strong> I like these debates. Reading a framework IE structural violence or explaining via an observation how the debate should be framed is helpful because it clarifies for me how to evaluate the debate. I like this in debates, it makes things easier for me. If you are reading a framework be sure to extend it in every speech and use it as a lens to explain your impacts in the debate/weigh your impacts against your opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>I think PF should be more accessible to the general public than policy. With that being said I have not seen a team go too fast yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Theory:</strong> This is silly. Disclosure theory is silly. Do not read it in front of me. Do not read any theory arguments in front of me. I will not vote on them. With that being said arguing that your opponents are not fitting within the bounds of the resolution is a good argument to make if it applies. If you make this argument and have warrants and impacts do not be afraid to go for it in final focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-traditional stuff:</strong> I enjoy creative takes on the topic, unique cases, and smart argumentation. I do think that PF should always revolve around the topic, I also think the topic is broader than most do. That being said avoid jargon. You can make a lot of creative arguments in this event, do so while avoiding weird debate jargon. No this does not contradict the \"theory\" section above.

I competed for Flower Mound High School for two years. I mainly competed in Congress, and qualified for TFA State and NSDA Nationals in my senior year. I also have experience with extemp and occasionally competed in PF and WSD.\n========================================================================================================\nAll Events\nBeing racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. is an auto L/low rank\nTech > truth\nIf it's before 9:30 am on a Saturday treat me like a lay\nEmail me after round if you have questions about your ballot, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible\n========================================================================================================\nCongress\n\"Congress is a debate event you silly goose (x65)\"\n-Grant Davis\nFor speeches\n\nGood sources with high quality analysis are the most important part of any speech\nLater speeches should have clash\nRhetoric/style is important, but isn't a substitute for content\nDO NOT BREAK CYCLE. If you get to the point where one side has nothing to say there's no reason to keep the debate going on that bill\nBe prepared to give sponsorships, there's nothing worse than having to take a 5 minute recess before the first speech\nQuestioning is important, but don't ask softball/filler questions\nQuality of speeches >>>>>>>>>>> quantity of speeches. Base 2 is not a rule, and precedence exists for a reason\nMaking jokes is encouraged, but don't be mean\n\nFor PO's\n\nDon't be afraid to PO if you don't have a lot of experience, I'll be pretty lenient in prelim rounds with the occasional mistake as long as it doesn't seriously impact the flow of the round\nThat being said, you aren't guaranteed to break if you preside; you are still being ranked in comparison with everyone else in the room\nBreak round PO's should be nearly perfect to be ranked highly\nMaking a joke about being more/less efficient than the actual congress = auto 9\n\n========================================================================================================\nPublic Forum\nWhile I did some PF as a debater, my experience with it has mostly been as a judge.

I don't have a hard limit for speed but if I look really sad and I'm not typing you should probably slow down\nCross is binding but I won't be flowing\nsignposting and organization are crucial\nweighing is incredibly important and should start as early in the round as possible\nspeaks are mainly based on strategy and clarity\n\nLARP (1)\nThis is the type of round I'm the most comfortable judging. Nothing groundbreaking here, read Eli Glickman or Amogh Mahambre's paradigms for more info on how I judge these debates. The easiest path to my ballot is to keep the debate organized and cleanly collapse on your best arguments instead of trying to go for everything. Don't be afraid to collapse to a single argument, and if you collapse on a single turn and win the round I'll probably boost your speaks. Also, not everything needs to link into a nuke war extinction scenario.\nTricks/TT (1)\nVery fun, please run these\nTheory (2)\nI think theory is a valuable way to check abuse. I don't love frivolous theory, but I'll still vote on it. I default to reasonability, no RVIs, and DTA, but can be convinced otherwise.\nK/Phil (3)\nI'm lumping these together since I have very little firsthand experience with either of them.

Debaters who work hard to be the best will have a better chance of winning my ballot: this means both before the round, through thoughtful, in-depth research, during the round, through excellent strategic decision making, and after the round, where I am open to discussions with both teams about how to improve for the future.</p>\n<p>I will carefully flow the debate and make a decision based on what I\u2019ve flowed for the team I believe has done the better technical debating. Compared to other judges, I think that I need teams to do more impact comparison and internal link analysis to win an argument that I consider a voting issue. I will do my best to not intervene during my decision: this practically means that I want more in-depth warranting for arguments you think are voting issues.</p>\n<p>2) Public Forum</p>\n<p>A. General Thoughts</p>\n<p>I keep a tight flow and will make decisions primarily based on content and strategy rather than style or presentation. I will give more weight to arguments that are grounded in solid evidence, are excellently warranted when first presented, and fully developed during the back half of the round. In short, I will try to intervene as little as possible, and I am theoretically willing to vote on any argument.</p>\n<p>I have no preference on the construction of your cases, but I\u2019ve noticed that cases constructed with cut cards, or those that directly quote evidence, are generally more persuasive than cases constructed via paraphrasing evidence, normally because the paraphrasing sacrifices warrants for additional claims. First crossfire should begin to deal with framing questions and start to center in on the central questions in the debate, setting up the rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Second rebuttal should begin to condense the round. I expect that it answers the first rebuttal to enough of an extent that I could reasonably see what you could go for in summary. While there are some cases where the second rebuttal should go for all arguments in the debate, those are rare - generally speaking, I think that the first speaking team comes out ahead when that happens. I find myself voting for teams that more aggressively condense the round more often than teams that go for every single argument, though this is not a hard and fast rule.</p>\n<p>Second summary is too late to make new arguments to anything in the first rebuttal speech, including defensive arguments. Obviously, anything that you want me to vote on must be in both the summary and final focus speeches. Similarly, final focus speeches which focus on detailed comparison of a couple of arguments rather than going for many arguments generally win my ballot more often. I generally think that the earlier you begin weighing arguments, the more compelling they are by the end of the round.</p>\n<p>If you do not give a significant amount of attention to your evidence's quality, you should consider striking me. The representation and quality of your evidence is very important to me, and ethical violations related to evidence may be a voting issue, even if your opponent does not call you out. In practice, however, I am hesitant to vote against a team if the piece of evidence that I think is questionable was not a) explicitly called out by the other team and b) does not make a substantive difference in my decision. Please make my job easy and call out garbage evidence so that it doesn't feel like I have to intervene to vote against it: though I reserve the right to do so, if I think it's warranted.</p>\n<p>B. Critical Arguments</p>\n<p>I am amenable to the recent trend of more critical argumentation in PF debate and I will happily vote on well-researched critical strategies in many different forms. That said, I think that these strategies have been executed relatively poorly when I have seen them. Too many teams are relying on arguments which I think are, functionally, \u201cwe talked about x group of people or y concept and therefore you should vote for us purely due to our \u2018pre-fiat, discourse\u2019 impacts\u201d which I find incredibly unpersuasive. While I think that discussions rooted in critical literature are important and welcome in PF, your initiation of that discussion alone is generally insufficient for me to vote for you. You still need an impact to win the debate, and I will still be weighing your arguments versus your opponents in an offense/defense paradigm to determine the winner of the round. In other words, I do not think that \"spreading awareness\" or \"discourse\" is a terminal impact.</p>\n<p>If you would like to use the round for a friendly discussion between both teams of some kind of oppression, that's fine. I won't take anything away from your decision to use the space as you see fit. But, my job as a judge is to adjudicate debates and award a winner, loser, and speaker points. If a team concedes the debate, I will select a winner, award speaker points based on the quality of debating done by each side, submit my ballot, and may choose to leave the room. If either team would like to ask me brief questions, as during a normal RFD, I will be happy to entertain those questions, but at this point in Public Forum's evolution, I believe that the time spent on the vast majority of these friendly discussions would be better spent having a debate about the issues raised during these discussions.</p>\n<p>C. Theory:</p>\n<p>I strongly dislike judging most theory debates in PF, and I would prefer to hear a debate about the topic than a theory debate, but I'm willing to grit my teeth and vote for you if it's warranted. I will evaluate theory debates through an offense-defense paradigm: the same way I would evaluate any other argument. I find theory with a clear violation and abuse story more compelling - it is an uphill battle to get me to vote on purely potential abuse rather than proven abuse if the other team makes a compelling we meet or reasonability argument. I probably think that reasonability arguments are more persuasive than most of my judge peers.</p>\n<p>I am only interested in impacts to fairness/access and education filtered through the lens of endorsing a given interpretation. When answering theory, keep in mind that I am exceedingly unlikely to vote on arguments based on the socioeconomic status of one or both teams or arguments that assert that theory \"does not belong\" in Public Forum.</p>\n<p>I personally believe that disclosure on the national circuit is generally good and paraphrasing is generally bad. I will not hack for these arguments, though it will be a severe uphill battle to win \u201cparaphrasing good\u201d in front of me.</p>\n<p>For a variety of reasons, I cannot stand judging disclosure theory debates: initiating such a debate will cap your speaker points at 25. I'll still vote on the argument if I think you win the debate, but I find these debates totally mind-numbing, and would rather hear a debate about literally anything else. If you don\u2019t like theory, I recommend disclosing and reading from cut cards or at least representing your evidence well.</p>\n<p>D. Pet Peeves</p>\n<p>Long off time roadmaps, blippy or unwarranted arguments that are magically expanded in later speeches, \"cards\" which are a sentence long strung together as a series of claims, aggressive/loud crossfire with a lot of cross talk, grand crossfire generally, dismissing arguments as \"improbable\" without warranting that argument, taking more than a minute to send evidence.</p>\n<p>If you have other questions, please ask before the round either in the room or via an email.

Because I don't judge much, it is important to speak clearly and to articulate the things that you want me to pay close attention to. If you go too fast and don't follow this advice you will lose me. I will not vote off of something that I didn't understand. You need to make my path to your ballot clear. I like certain types of theory arguments and will vote off of them if there is a demonstrated abuse (topicality, disclosure, etc.). My firm belief is that you should debate the topic assigned. I also am a big fan of disclosure. I think that it levels the playing field for all involved. Drops matter. Impacting is important. Giving clear reasons why you are winning offense is the easiest way to pick up my ballot.\n\n\n\n\n", "links": [], "emails": [], "scraped_at": "2024-01-09T14:22:40.103362Z", "hash": "e72b6920d776abf954b9b25a", "tab_tourn_id": 28021, "judge_id": "c40d8e0e87cd8996a3dd2511", "flow_confidence": 8, "progressive_confidence": 3}, {"html": "<div class=\"paradigm ltborderbottom\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Strake Jesuit '19|University of Houston '23</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Email Chain/Questions: <a>nacurry23@gmail.com</a></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Tech&gt;Truth</strong> \u2013 I\u2019ll vote on anything as long as it\u2019s warranted.

If you paraphrase and the evidence I get is shockingly bad, I will be mad >:(\nProgressive arguments\nstay clippin\njk don't actually clip \u2013 it's against the rules!\nI'm going to list my beliefs on theory here, because I think that when it comes to arguments about norm-setting for the activity, my obligation to be \"tech\" comes second to my obligation to promote education. What this means in practice is that in close theory rounds, I am likely to pick up the team whose practices/behavior aligns with what I believe is good for debate. That said, I'm still willing to listen to theory debates and if the round is an absolute smack down I won't intervene against theory shells I think are unnecessary but not harmful.\nparaphrasing is bad. Para good warrants are balls and my threshold for responding to them is quite low.\ndisclosure is good. OS (tagged and highlighted ev) >>>>>>> full text (no tags or highlights) > first three last three (read OS interps! disclosure nowdays is kinda egregious)\nTWs for non-graphic descriptions of violence r bad \u2013 the idea that marginalized groups have to ask for permission to talk about oppression, even when their arguments are edited and censored to be non-graphic, is not slay. That said, if you want to run TWs good I will evaluate it and won't intervene against it \u2013 again, I'm listing my beliefs here so you're not surprised how my ballot turns out in close/messy rounds.\nround reports r unnecessary but I'm willing to eval the theory.\nI default to competing interps (risk offense means I'll probably vote on a shell if there's no counter-interp). However, I am sympathetic to reasonability arguments if they are made in round.\nDon't push it with theory, I will try my best to be open-minded and not intervene against silly interps (round reports cough cough) but the more you get into the shoes theory, 30 speaker point theory, etc side of things the more likely I am to not evaluate it. Even then, I dislike the trend in the circuit towards weaponizing evidence rules/disclosure practices to punish teams with good practices \u2013 to me, there is a qualitative difference between reading disclosure on a team who doesn't disclose and reading open sources on a team who does first three last three. Again, I'm not going to intervene on face if you're reading theory in this vein, just don't go too far down this rabbit hole.\nRVIs to para or disco are domeless. I vibe with RVIs: 1) if you're running a ROTB about topical discourse 2) If the theory is obviously friv\nI know the very basics of cap and security Ks, if you run anything beyond that make sure to send docs and explain it clearly.\nMisc\nTime your own prep.\nDon't say offensive things!

I am always happy to do what I can after the round to help you out.</p>\n<p><strong>General Paradigm:</strong></p>\n<p>- I will enforce speech times, prep time, etc with a timer and the ballot (if its like absolutely egregious, taking multiple minutes longer than you are allowed, etc)</p>\n<p>- In most PF rounds, roadmaps aren't necessary, just tell me where you are starting and signpost.

More often than not, clarity matters more than WPM. I know debaters who speak super fast, and I can understand every word, and I know debaters who don't speak fast but are still super unclear, and vice versa. I will say clear if I cant follow. You can spread IF you are doing it like it is done in policy (spreading long cards, not a bunch of paraphrased garbage, slow down on tags/authors, sending out a speech doc is a must). IF you spread AND paraphrase, however, your chances of winning points of clash immediately plummet.</p>\n<p>- Pls send speech docs with cut cards, I will probably ask for them so then I can read cards without having to call for a million different ones, and it shortens the amount of time taken for ev exchange by a million, so just pls send them.</p>\n<p>- Weighing: You need to weigh on both the link and impact level, very often the team that weighs will pick up my ballot. I don't hate buzzwords as much as other PF judges, but I do need an explanation. Please start weighing as early as possible, in the rebuttals if you can. Early weighing helps you make strategic decisions and makes my life easier since weighing is what guides my ballot. I will always prefer weighing done earlier and dropped, over late weighing so weigh early and often. The evaluation of the round on my ballot starts and ends with weighing and it controls where I look to vote. I don't need a story or a super clear narrative, but write my ballot for me and make it easy. In line with this, I would highly encourage you to go for less and weigh more.</p>\n<p>- Collapse: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE collapse, preferably starting in second rebuttal. This makes all of our lives easier because you don't want to have to spam buzzwords blippily in response to some poorly extended argument, and I don't want to sift through a flow with tons of tags and zero warrants or weighing. Pick an argument to go for, and weigh that argument. That is the easiest way to pick up my ballot. Debate isn't a scoreboard, winning 3 arguments doesn't mean you get my ballot if your opponent only wins 1 argument.</p>\n<p>- I cannot believe I have to make this a part of my paradigm, it should be exceedingly obvious, but no delinks or non-uniques on yourself (specifically that delinks the link you read in case or something which makes the opposite argument that you made initially) to get out of turn offense. It makes being first impossible and its just so stupid. I won't evaluate those arguments and your opponents are free to extend those turns. Obviously, you can concede your opponents defense, but you cant read it on yourself, new in second rebuttal.</p>\n<p>- If the 1st constructive introduces framework, the 2nd constructive probably should respond to it (or at least make arguments as to why they can respond later). I don't know where i stand on this technically yet, but this is where i am leaning now, arguments can be made either way on this issue in round and i will evaluate them normally, but if the 1st constructive introduces framework and the 2nd constructive drops it, i think its ok for the first rebuttal to call it conceded unless otherwise argued.</p>\n<p>- On advocacies/T: This is something that should be resolved in the round and I will eval the flow if this argument is made but my personal thoughts are as follows. Because the neg doesn't get a CP in PF, the aff's advocacy does not block the neg out of ground (basically neither side gets to control the others ground). The aff does the whole aff, the neg can garner DAs off of the aff's advocacy or any interpretation of what the aff could look like, not just what that aff was in that round. An example would be the neg could still read a Russia provocation negative on the NATO topic (Septober 2021) even if the aff does not read a troop deployment advocacy for their advantages. Alternatively, if the neg can get a CP then I suppose the aff can get an advocacy. Either way works - the point being that PF should consider some sort of method to adjudicate this in round.</p>\n<p>- Be nice and respectful, but keep it light and casual if you can! Debate is fun, so lets treat it as such.</p>\n<p>- I will be quick to drop debaters and arguments that are any -ism, and I won't listen to arguments like racism, sexism, death, patriarchy (etc) good. The space first and foremost needs to be safe to participate in.</p>\n<p>- I don't care what you what you wear, where you sit, if you swear (sometimes a few F-bombs can make an exceedingly boring debate just a little less so!), if you do the flip or enter the room before im there, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>\n<p>I like cut cards and quality evidence, I hate paraphrasing. Disclaimer: this is going to seem cranky, but I don't mind well-warranted analytics. I just hate paraphrasing. Ev is always better than an analytic, but if you introduce an arg as an analytic, I won't mind and will evaluate it as such. But if your opponents have evidence, you will likely lose that clash point. Here a few main points on evidence issues:</p>\n<p>- Evidence is the backbone of the activity, otherwise it devolves into some really garbage nonsense (I do not value debate as a lying competition). As a result, debates about evidence are very easy ways to pick me up. Arguments about evidence preference are very good in front of me, and I will probably call for cards at the end of the round because most debate evidence is horrifically miscut or paraphrased. Evidence quality is very very important, and I have NO PROBLEM intervening against awful evidence especially in close rounds. Good evidence is important for education and quality of debate, so if you have bad evidence, I am happy to drop you for it to improve the activity and hopefully teach you a lesson. This applies to both if you cut cards or paraphrase, because cutting cards doesn't make you immune to lying about it, so generally cut good cards, and read good evidence.</p>\n<p>- Paraphrasing: The single worst wide-spread practice in PF debate today is paraphrasing. Its just so obviously silly. Its bad for the quality of debate, its bad for all of its educational benefits, and its unfair. I hate it so so much. So please cut cards, its not difficult and it makes everyone's lives better. That said, I know that it happens regardless so here are a few things important for the in round if you do paraphrase:</p>\n<p>a. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have a cut card or at least a paragraph, you absolutely need to be able to have this, its a rule now. Your opponents do not need to take prep to sort through your PDFs, and if you cant quickly produce the evidence and where you paraphrased it from, I'm crossing the argument off my flow. I have very little tolerance for long, paraphrased evidence exchanges where you claim to have correctly paraphrased 100 page PDFs and expect your opponents to be able to check against your bad evidence with the allotted prep time.</p>\n<p>b. If you paraphrase, you MUST be reading full arguments. 40 authors in 1st rebuttal by spreading tag blips and paraphrasing authors to make it faster is not acceptable and your speaks will tank. Claim, warrant, ev is all required if I am going to vote on it or even flow it.</p>\n<p>c. If you misrepresent a card while paraphrasing, not only is that bad in a vacuum, but I will give you the L25. If you realize its badly represented OR you cant find it when asked and you make the arg \"just evaluate as an analytic\" I will also give an L25 and be in a really bad mood. Its a terrible, terrible argument, so please dont make it. If you introduce the evidence, you have to be able to defend it.</p>\n<p>d. Dont be mad at me if you get bad speaks. There is no longer world in which someone who paraphrases, even if they give the perfect speech gets above a 29 in front of me. I used to be more forgiving on this, but no longer.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">- Evidence exchange: if the header \"paraphrasing\" meant you skipped over that part of my paradigm, I will reiterate something that is important regardless of how you introduce the evidence; if you cant produce a card upon being asked for it within a minute or two, at best you get lowest speaks I can give and probably the L too.</span></p>\n<p>- Even if its not theory, arguments that I should prefer cut cards over paraphrased cards at the clash points are going to work in front of me. Please make those arguments, I think they are very true.</p>\n<p>- Another thing im shocked i have to put in my paradigm, but you need to cite the author you are reading even if you paraphrase from them, for it to be counted as evidence and not an analytic. if you read something without citing an author, I will flow it as an analytic and if your opponents call for that piece of ev, and you hand it to them without citing it in the round, I am dropping you. Its plagiarism and extremely unethical. This is an educational activity, come on ppl.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive paradigm:</strong></p>\n<p>DISLCAIMER: Deep in my bones, I believe that debate is good. It may presently be flawed, but I believe the activity has value and can be transformative. Arguments that say debate is bad, and should be destroyed entirely (often times this is the conclusion of non-topical pess arguments, killjoy, the like) will be evaluated but my biases towards the activity being good WILL impact the decision. Doesn't mean they are unwinnable, but it is probably wildly unstrategic to run them.</p>\n<p>I'm receptive to all args, including progressive ones in the debate space, but they have been getting REALLY low quality recently. I worry about the long term impact about some of these really bad versions on the activity. Please, think about the model you are advocating for, think about if its sincerely going to make the space better for the people growing up in it.</p>\n<p>- While there are obvious upsides to progressive arguments, I don't appreciate frivolous theory (see below). This does include spikes and tricks, I don't like them, pls don't run them. If the theory is frivolous, and I reserve the right to determine that, I won't vote on it no matter the breakdown of the round.</p>\n<p>- I won't vote for auto-30 speaker point arguments</p>\n<p>Theory:</p>\n<p>- I probably default to competing interps unless told otherwise, but that doesn't really mean much if you read the rest of this paradigm. I am going to evaluate the flow, so if you read theory arguments that I won't intervene against, I am going to evaluate it normally.</p>\n<p>- I generally think no-RVIs. The exception to this might be an RVI on IVIs.</p>\n<p>- IVIs are really bad for debate. If they are a rules claim, make it a theory shell. Most of the time, they are vague whines that are spammed off in the span of 4 seconds without any explanation. This proliferation is nearly existential for the activity, and it needs to stop.</p>\n<p>- I have no problem intervening against frivolous theory (i.e. shoe theory), so if you run theory in front of me, please believe that its actually educational for the activity. Even theory like social distancing or contact info are ones where its hard to win in front of me, and in some contexts I probably won't vote on it. Resolved theory and other nonsense will barely warrant getting flowed for me, I won't vote on them.</p>\n<p>- Theory needs to be read in the speech following the violation. Out of round violations should be read in constructive.</p>\n<p>- Paraphrasing is bad: I will vote on paraphrasing bad most of the time, as long as theres some offense on the shell. I personally think its good for the debate space and am very predisposed to voting for it. I will NEVER vote on paraphrasing good, I don't care how mad that may make you to hear, I just won't do it. If you introduce cut cards bad or paraphrasing good as a new off (like before a para bad shell) I will instantly drop you. That said, you can win enough defense on a paraphrasing shell to make it not a voter. Paraphrasing theory is the exception to the disclaimers outlined above, I think paraphrasing should be punished in round and am happy to vote on it.</p>\n<p>- Disclosure is good: I am less excited to hear it because typically, disclosure rounds are really bad and messy. Open source is good too, I have come around on it, so you can basically run whatever disclosure interp you want. Run it if you think you can win it, but dont be fearful to hear it ran against you in front of me. Respond to it, and I will vote as I would a normal flow.</p>\n<p>- Trigger warnings: This theory has been read a lot more recently, I will eval it like a normal shell, but for the record, I think trigger warnings in PF are usually bad, and usually run on arguments that dont need to be trigger warned which just suppresses voices and arguments in the activity. You can go for the theory, but my threshold for responses will be in accordance with that belief typically.</p>\n<p>Kritiks/Arguments that people in PF are calling \"Kritiks\" even when they are not:</p>\n<p>- I am all good with kritiks, although im not as experienced with them as I am with other args, but that isnt a reason not to run a K in front of me. I will be able to flow it and vote on it as long as you explain it well.</p>\n<p>- Blake 2021 made me think about this a lot, and I think the activity is just going through growing pains that are necessary, but some of these debates were really bad. So please think through all of the arguments you read, so that you can articulate exactly what my ballot does or what specifically I am supposed to be doing. This means implicating responses or arguments onto the FW debate, or the ROTB.</p>\n<p>- Also, no one thinks fiat is real (pre/post-fiat is just an inaccurate and irrelevant label), so lets be more specific about how we label arguments or discourse. Make comparisons as to why your discourse or type of education is more important than theirs, this is not done by slapping the label \"pre-fiat\" onto an argument because NO ONE THINKS ITS REAL. Just get past that label and explain why.</p>\n<p>- You also need to do a pretty good amount of work explaining why or how discourse shapes reality, just asserting it does isn't much of a warrant and this debate is always underdeveloped in rounds I am in.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaks:</strong></p>\n<p>I will probably give around a 27-28 in most rounds. I guess I give lower speaks than most PF judges, so I\u2019ll clarify. 27-28 is middling to me with various degrees within that. 26-27 is bad, not always for ethical reasons. Below a 26 is an ethical issue. If you get above a 29 from me you should be very happy bc I never give speaks that high almost ever.</p>\n</div>", "text": "\nBlake '21, UChicago '25\nDid PF on the nat circuit for 3 years and I am currently an Assistant Coach for Blake.\nTl;dr:\n- Pls run paraphrasing theory: Paraphrasing is awful, evidence is VERY important to me and I am happy to use the ballot to punish bad ethics in round.\n- Send speech docs, its better for everyone.\n- Strike me if you don't read cut cards/if you paraphrase or don't think evidence is important, you will be happy that you did.\n- I flow.\n- Tech>truth.\n- All kinds of speed are fine, spreading too as long as you are not paraphrasing.\n- 2nd rebuttal must frontline, defense isn't sticky, and if I'm something is going to be mentioned on my ballot, it must be in both back half speeches.\n- Please weigh.\n- I will let your opponents take prep for as long as it takes for you to send your doc or cards without it counting towards their 3 minutes, so send docs pls and send them fast.\n- The following people have shaped how I view debate: Ale Perri (hi Ale), Christian Vasquez, Bryce Piotrowski, Darren Chang, and Shane Stafford.\njenebo21@gmail.com AND blakedocs@googlegroups.com -- Put BOTH on the email chain, and feel free to contact me after the round (on Facebook preferably, or email if you must) if you have questions or need anything from me.

Most of the time, they are vague whines that are spammed off in the span of 4 seconds without any explanation. This proliferation is nearly existential for the activity, and it needs to stop.\n- I have no problem intervening against frivolous theory (i.e. shoe theory), so if you run theory in front of me, please believe that its actually educational for the activity. Even theory like social distancing or contact info are ones where its hard to win in front of me, and in some contexts I probably won't vote on it. Resolved theory and other nonsense will barely warrant getting flowed for me, I won't vote on them.\n- Theory needs to be read in the speech following the violation. Out of round violations should be read in constructive.\n- Paraphrasing is bad: I will vote on paraphrasing bad most of the time, as long as theres some offense on the shell. I personally think its good for the debate space and am very predisposed to voting for it. I will NEVER vote on paraphrasing good, I don't care how mad that may make you to hear, I just won't do it. If you introduce cut cards bad or paraphrasing good as a new off (like before a para bad shell) I will instantly drop you. That said, you can win enough defense on a paraphrasing shell to make it not a voter. Paraphrasing theory is the exception to the disclaimers outlined above, I think paraphrasing should be punished in round and am happy to vote on it.\n- Disclosure is good: I am less excited to hear it because typically, disclosure rounds are really bad and messy. Open source is good too, I have come around on it, so you can basically run whatever disclosure interp you want. Run it if you think you can win it, but dont be fearful to hear it ran against you in front of me. Respond to it, and I will vote as I would a normal flow.\n- Trigger warnings: This theory has been read a lot more recently, I will eval it like a normal shell, but for the record, I think trigger warnings in PF are usually bad, and usually run on arguments that dont need to be trigger warned which just suppresses voices and arguments in the activity. You can go for the theory, but my threshold for responses will be in accordance with that belief typically.\nKritiks/Arguments that people in PF are calling \"Kritiks\" even when they are not:\n- I am all good with kritiks, although im not as experienced with them as I am with other args, but that isnt a reason not to run a K in front of me. I will be able to flow it and vote on it as long as you explain it well.\n- Blake 2021 made me think about this a lot, and I think the activity is just going through growing pains that are necessary, but some of these debates were really bad. So please think through all of the arguments you read, so that you can articulate exactly what my ballot does or what specifically I am supposed to be doing. This means implicating responses or arguments onto the FW debate, or the ROTB.\n- Also, no one thinks fiat is real (pre/post-fiat is just an inaccurate and irrelevant label), so lets be more specific about how we label arguments or discourse. Make comparisons as to why your discourse or type of education is more important than theirs, this is not done by slapping the label \"pre-fiat\" onto an argument because NO ONE THINKS ITS REAL. Just get past that label and explain why.\n- You also need to do a pretty good amount of work explaining why or how discourse shapes reality, just asserting it does isn't much of a warrant and this debate is always underdeveloped in rounds I am in.\nSpeaks:\nI will probably give around a 27-28 in most rounds. I guess I give lower speaks than most PF judges, so I\u2019ll clarify. 27-28 is middling to me with various degrees within that. 26-27 is bad, not always for ethical reasons. Below a 26 is an ethical issue. If you get above a 29 from me you should be very happy bc I never give speaks that high almost ever.\n", "links": [], "emails": ["jenebo21@gmail.com", "blakedocs@googlegroups.com"], "scraped_at": "2024-01-09T14:22:40.103362Z", "hash": "0d2658dc8ae32d4babc111a4", "tab_tourn_id": 28021, "judge_id": "086b61a8364cc826cc8d86d5", "flow_confidence": 9, "progressive_confidence": 4}, {"html": "<div class=\"paradigm ltborderbottom\">\n<p><strong>important: please do not read arguments pertaining to human trafficking/sexual violence in front of me. by that, i mean don't dehighlight the cards and replace sexual violence with gendered violence. i cannot hear these arguments. read an alternate.</strong></p>\n<p>add me to the email chain - 19sabrina.huang@gmail.com</p>\n<p>i debated under cps hp. currently i coach/judge for american heritage. i don't think i'm super picky but heres some basic stuff:</p>\n<p>you have to send a marked version of the speech doc if you did not get through your whole doc. you must delete the cards you did not read and visibly mark cards that you did not complete reading.</p>\n<p>postrounding for clarification questions/feedback is fine. postrounding bc u think u won and ur tryna convince me u shoulda is not. just try to keep it short - i will cut you off at a certain point</p>\n<p>william and i were really techy so that's the kind of debate i'm best at judging. but if both teams wanna have a lay round, that's fine too. i'll give feedback based off of how convincing you sound or sum</p>\n<p>in general don't be a jerk, esp in cx/crossfire. it's fine to be witty, but if you're being rude your speaks will get tanked. my bar for being a jerk is pretty high tho. either way, cross isn't binding.</p>\n<p>generally please dont yell that much, calm down it aint that deep ????</p>\n<p>first and foremost, i prioritize the safety of debaters. that means: don't trigger people, use correct pronouns, etc.</p>\n<p>that also means i wont evaluate any arguments rooted in bigotry. i will also not evaluate death good. be mature, and good people. also idt u can run pess if both of u arent black. i cannot believe i have to say this, but dont</p>\n<p>to quote miguel harvey: \"<strong>DO NOT PERPETUATE THE TOXIC, PRIVILEGED MALE PF ARCHETYPE.

If you\u2019re a spectator or a competitor in a speech room, you deserve the opportunity to step out. If you\u2019re competing in a debate round, you have every right to ask your competitors to read a version of their case that excludes the triggering material. As a judge, I reserve the right to step out/turn off my camera for a moment before you give your performance.</p>\n<p>In a debate round, I\u2019d appreciate that triggering material cut out. I don\u2019t think intense/graphic depictions of human suffering add much to your overall case anyway, I\u2019d rather you extend cards in that time or frontline or do anything besides exploit human suffering.</p>\n<p>If I correct your pronunciation of a word in my ballot, it\u2019s genuinely to educate you. It\u2019s hard to know how to pronounce a word you\u2019ve never heard aloud, just read (looking at you, Reuters!)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have a degree in history, with a focus on Latin American history. Keep that in mind when discussing issues focused on Latin America. Feel free to ask me for a reading list to better understand conflicts, revolutions, and government suppression (including US intervention) in Guatemala, Argentina, Honduras, El Salvador, and more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are spectating an event and are fully texting in front of me or attempting to talk to/distract a competitor, I\u2019m going to ask you to leave. I will not warn you once, I have a zero-tolerance policy for disrespecting competitors or interfering with competition in that way.</p>\n</div>", "text": "\nMy pronouns are they/them/theirs.

I know LD's norm is sending 30 minutes before round, I think that's a great norm.\nIn PF, send case docs. Don't be secretive with your cards. Your opponents should not have to disclose a disability in order to get you to send docs. I also think sending a speech doc for rebuttal and summary is a good norm. This is not (necessarily) something I'll down you for but it could be, if you're intentionally being harmful.\nI will evaluate anything as long as it's warranted and extended. I won't make arguments for you, tell me why and how you're winning. I'll vote tech over truth unless the truth overwhelms the tech. Sticky defense is so fake, extend your arguments if you want to win them. Unextended = dropped. Proper extensions, tag and cite, claim, warrant, impact!!\nBoth partners need to participate in grand cross. PF is a partner event! No, you can't skip grand cross. I'm listening to cross and waiting to hear the questions from cross brought into round.\nPlease do a www.speechdrop.net room, it is a fantastic site, and I will definitely pop in and read cards and cases if you have the speechdrop room set up. Always send case, always send speech docs. I am #notsponsored, just a fan! My email is down below.\nSpell out all the abbreviations you use in round. Don\u2019t assume I know what you\u2019re talking about. People know what the UN is, the EU, etc, people may not know BRI, any random trade agreement, etc.\n\nspeed: You don't have to go at a conversational pace but nobody should be full-on-spreading in PF. When you're off the doc, you have to go slower. I try not to flow off the doc but I will use it as support if you're faster than I can follow. I'm not in a debate round to read off your case doc, I'm in round to hear YOU. Slow down on taglines, analytics, authors- basically anything you think is vital to my decision.\n\nPF-specific comments:\n\nI'll vote on anything but getting me to vote on framework in a PF round is an uphill battle, especially if it's not fully developed. saying \"we have a framework\" is not sufficient to win on framework\nextensions are not just saying \"Extend my contention 2\", you must extend the card tag/cite and the claim, warrant, and impact! Let me hear the link chain again!!\nspeaker points- these national tournaments keep giving me a rubric to use and I'm trying to apply that to all the realms I judge in. Points start at 28 and I adjust from there. Points will only be below a 27 if you did something harmful or rules/norms were horribly broken.\nyes I'll vote on anything, but no I don't want to hear K's 95% of the time. If you read a K, I still expect you to interact with your opponent's case. There is not a lot of room for theory in PF. I reject the policy debatification of PF.\nPFers, please read cards with actual taglines. \"furthermore\", \"and\", are not taglines. A tag is the thesis of the card, it is the summary of the content. I've been seeing a lot of that lately- it's lazy and bad practice.\n\n\nLD-specific:\n\nI don't judge LD often, not as comfortable with LD speeds but I'll use the doc\nI will evaluate k's, as long as they're well-developed and defended. i know theory is normative in LD and I'll do my best to evaluate it fairly and wisely\nI know this event is generally more technical but again, don't assume I know what you're talking about!! spell out all your abbreviations, provide definitions (especially if you're reading a K), do your best to make the round and the space more accessible!\n\n\n\nemail- theedebatecoach@gmail.com \nand \ndocs.anderson@gmail.com \nplease <3\n\n\nThis message is specifically for competitors in debate events; I value respect in the round. Please don\u2019t be rude in front of me. It doesn\u2019t make me laugh, it reminds me of uncomfortable/unpleasant rounds where my competitors were rude to me or my partner. That has no business in a debate space, please don\u2019t bring that energy into a round. This goes double for people in privileged positions who make women and gender/racial minorities uncomfortable or unsafe in the debate space. Not only will I chew you out and tank your speaks, but I will also let your coach know about the harmful practices. it's on all of us to make the debate space inclusive and equitable.\nTLDR- be nice, be kind, and be self-aware.\n\nCongress comments:\nI did congressional debate all four years I competed in high school, I really enjoyed it and love watching a good Congress round. I have a lot of respect for a strong PO and usually reward that with a higher ranking. POs that struggle with precedence, maintaining decorum, and Robert's rules of order will have that reflected in their rank.\nClash, clash, clash! Put the debate into congressional debate.\nThere's a line between sassy and rude. Tread it carefully.\n\nGeneral comments:\nsomething that I genuinely appreciate in every event is a trigger warning before potentially triggering performances and speeches. controversially, I care about all of your experiences in a round and would like to give everyone an opportunity to opt out. If you\u2019re a spectator or a competitor in a speech room, you deserve the opportunity to step out. If you\u2019re competing in a debate round, you have every right to ask your competitors to read a version of their case that excludes the triggering material. As a judge, I reserve the right to step out/turn off my camera for a moment before you give your performance.\nIn a debate round, I\u2019d appreciate that triggering material cut out. I don\u2019t think intense/graphic depictions of human suffering add much to your overall case anyway, I\u2019d rather you extend cards in that time or frontline or do anything besides exploit human suffering.\nIf I correct your pronunciation of a word in my ballot, it\u2019s genuinely to educate you. It\u2019s hard to know how to pronounce a word you\u2019ve never heard aloud, just read (looking at you, Reuters!)\n\nI have a degree in history, with a focus on Latin American history. Keep that in mind when discussing issues focused on Latin America. Feel free to ask me for a reading list to better understand conflicts, revolutions, and government suppression (including US intervention) in Guatemala, Argentina, Honduras, El Salvador, and more.\n\nIf you are spectating an event and are fully texting in front of me or attempting to talk to/distract a competitor, I\u2019m going to ask you to leave. I will not warn you once, I have a zero-tolerance policy for disrespecting competitors or interfering with competition in that way.\n", "links": ["www.speechdrop.net", "https://www.speechdrop.net", "docs.anderson"], "emails": ["theedebatecoach@gmail.com", "docs.anderson@gmail.com"], "scraped_at": "2024-01-09T14:22:40.103362Z", "hash": "20c82004dcad32f5c7764730", "tab_tourn_id": 28021, "judge_id": "33cf6740d6b75f555de7745f", "flow_confidence": 7, "progressive_confidence": 4}, {"html": "<div class=\"paradigm ltborderbottom\">\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>My name is Atul Kapoor.

There is no grace period, there are no concluding thoughts. When the timer goes off, your speech or question/answer is over. Beyond that, there are a few things I will no longer budge on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You must read from cut cards the first time evidence is introduced into a round. The experiment with paraphrasing in a debate event was an interesting one, but the activity has shown itself to be unable to self-police what is and what is not academically dishonest representations of evidence. Comparisons to the work researchers and professors do in their professional life I think is laughable. Some of the shoddy evidence work I\u2019ve seen be passed off in this activity would have you fired in those contexts, whereas here it will probably get you in late elimination rounds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The inability to produce a piece of evidence when asked for it will end the round immediately. Taking more than thirty seconds to produce the evidence is unacceptable as that shows me you didn\u2019t read from it to begin with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arguments that are racist, sexist, transphobic, etc. will end the round immediately in an L and as few speaker points as Tab allows me to give out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Questions about what was and wasn\u2019t read in round that are not claims of clipping are signs of a skill issue and won\u2019t hold up rounds. If you want to ask questions outside of cross, run your own prep. A team saying \u201ccut card here\u201d or whatever to mark the docs they\u2019ve sent you is your sign to do so. If you feel personally slighted by the idea that you should flow better and waste less time in the round, please reconsider your approach to preparing for competitions that require you to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Defense is not \u201csticky.\u201d If you want something to count in the round, it needs to be included in your team\u2019s prior speech. The idea that a first speaking team can go \u201cAh, hah! You forgot about our trap card\u201d in the final focus after not extending it in summary is ridiculous and makes a joke out of the event.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Negotiables</strong></p>\n<p>These are not set in stone, and have changed over time. Running contrary to me on these positions isn\u2019t a big issue and I can be persuaded in the context of the round.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tech vs truth</em></strong></p>\n<p>To me, the activity has weirdly defined what \u201ctechnical\u201d debate is in a way that I believe undermines the value of the activity. Arguments being true if dropped is only as valid as the original construction of the argument. Am I opposed to big stick impacts? Absolutely not, I think they\u2019re worth engaging in and worth making policy decisions around. But, for example, if you cannot answer questions regarding what is the motivation for conflict, who would originally engage in the escalation ladder, or how the decision to launch a nuclear weapon is conducted, your argument was not valid to begin with. Asking me to close my eyes and just check the box after essentially saying \u201cyadda yadda, nuclear winter\u201d is as ridiculous as doing the opposite after hearing \u201cMAD checks\u201d with no explanation.</p>\n<p>Teams I think are being rewarded far too often for reading too many contentions in the constructive that are missing internal links. I am more than just sympathetic to the idea that calling this out amounts to terminal defense at this point. If they haven\u2019t formed a coherent argument to begin with, teams shouldn\u2019t be able to masquerade like they have one.</p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t a magical number of contentions that is either good or bad to determine whether this is an issue or not. The benefit of being a faster team is the ability to actually get more full arguments out in the round, but that isn\u2019t an advantage if you\u2019re essentially reading two sentences of a card and calling it good.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Theory</em></strong></p>\n<p>In PF debate only, I default to a position of reasonability. I think the theory debates in this activity, as they\u2019ve been happening, are terribly uninteresting and are mostly binary choices.</p>\n<p>Is disclosure good? Yes</p>\n<p>Is paraphrasing bad? Yes</p>\n<p>Distinctions beyond these I don\u2019t think are particularly valuable. Going for cheapshots on specifics I think is an okay starting position for me to say this is a waste of time and not worth voting for. That being said, I feel like a lot of teams do mis-disclose in PF by just throwing up huge unedited blocks of texts in their open source section. Proper disclosure includes the tags that are in case and at least the first and last three words of a card that you\u2019ve read. To say you open source disclose requires highlighting of the words you have actually read in round.</p>\n<p>That being said, answers that amount to whining aren\u2019t great. Teams that have PF theory read against them frequently respond in ways that mostly sound like they\u2019re confused/aghast that someone would question their integrity as debaters and at the end of the day that\u2019s not an argument. Teams should do more to articulate what specific calls to do x y or z actually do for the activity, rather than worrying about what they\u2019re feeling. If your coach requires you to do policy \u201cx\u201d then they should give you reasons to defend policy \u201cx.\u201d If you\u2019re consistently losing to arguments about what norms in the activity should look like, that\u2019s a talk you should have with your coach/program advisor about accepting them or creating better answers.</p>\n<p><strong><em>IVIs</em></strong></p>\n<p>These are hands down the worst thing that PF debate has come up with. If something in round arises to the issue of student safety, then I hope(and maybe this is misplaced) that a judge would intervene prior to a debater saying \u201cdo something.\u201d If something is just a dumb argument, or a dumb way to have an argument be developed, then it\u2019s either a theory issue or a competitor needs to get better at making an argument against it.</p>\n<p>The idea that these one-off sentences somehow protect students or make the activity more aware of issues is insane. Most things I\u2019ve heard called an IVI are misconstruing what a student has said, are a rules violation that need to be determined by tab, or are just an incomplete argument.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kritiks</em></strong></p>\n<p>Overall, I\u2019m sympathetic to these arguments made in any event, but I think that the PF version of them so far has left me underwhelmed. I am much better for things like cap, security, fem IR, afro-pess and the like than I am for anything coming from a pomo tradition/understanding. Survival strategies focused on identity issues that require voting one way or the other depending on a student\u2019s identification/orientation I think are bad for debate as a competitive activity.</p>\n<p>Kritiks should require some sort of link to either the resolution(since PF doesn\u2019t have plans really), or something the aff has done argumentatively or with their rhetoric. The nonexistence of a link means a team has decided to rant for their speech time, and not included a reason why I should care.</p>\n<p>Rejection alternatives are okay(Zizek and others were common when I was in debate for context) but teams reliant on \u201cdiscourse\u201d and other vague notions should probably strike me. If I do not know what voting for a team does, I am uncomfortable to do so and will actively seek out ways to avoid it.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>", "text": "\nFor WKU -\nThe last policy rounds I was in was around 2015 for context.

Taking more than thirty seconds to produce the evidence is unacceptable as that shows me you didn\u2019t read from it to begin with.\n\n\nArguments that are racist, sexist, transphobic, etc. will end the round immediately in an L and as few speaker points as Tab allows me to give out.\n\n\nQuestions about what was and wasn\u2019t read in round that are not claims of clipping are signs of a skill issue and won\u2019t hold up rounds. If you want to ask questions outside of cross, run your own prep. A team saying \u201ccut card here\u201d or whatever to mark the docs they\u2019ve sent you is your sign to do so. If you feel personally slighted by the idea that you should flow better and waste less time in the round, please reconsider your approach to preparing for competitions that require you to do so.\n\n\nDefense is not \u201csticky.\u201d If you want something to count in the round, it needs to be included in your team\u2019s prior speech. The idea that a first speaking team can go \u201cAh, hah! You forgot about our trap card\u201d in the final focus after not extending it in summary is ridiculous and makes a joke out of the event.\n\n\nNegotiables\nThese are not set in stone, and have changed over time. Running contrary to me on these positions isn\u2019t a big issue and I can be persuaded in the context of the round.\nTech vs truth\nTo me, the activity has weirdly defined what \u201ctechnical\u201d debate is in a way that I believe undermines the value of the activity. Arguments being true if dropped is only as valid as the original construction of the argument. Am I opposed to big stick impacts? Absolutely not, I think they\u2019re worth engaging in and worth making policy decisions around. But, for example, if you cannot answer questions regarding what is the motivation for conflict, who would originally engage in the escalation ladder, or how the decision to launch a nuclear weapon is conducted, your argument was not valid to begin with. Asking me to close my eyes and just check the box after essentially saying \u201cyadda yadda, nuclear winter\u201d is as ridiculous as doing the opposite after hearing \u201cMAD checks\u201d with no explanation.\nTeams I think are being rewarded far too often for reading too many contentions in the constructive that are missing internal links. I am more than just sympathetic to the idea that calling this out amounts to terminal defense at this point. If they haven\u2019t formed a coherent argument to begin with, teams shouldn\u2019t be able to masquerade like they have one.\nThere isn\u2019t a magical number of contentions that is either good or bad to determine whether this is an issue or not. The benefit of being a faster team is the ability to actually get more full arguments out in the round, but that isn\u2019t an advantage if you\u2019re essentially reading two sentences of a card and calling it good.\nTheory\nIn PF debate only, I default to a position of reasonability. I think the theory debates in this activity, as they\u2019ve been happening, are terribly uninteresting and are mostly binary choices.\nIs disclosure good? Yes\nIs paraphrasing bad? Yes\nDistinctions beyond these I don\u2019t think are particularly valuable. Going for cheapshots on specifics I think is an okay starting position for me to say this is a waste of time and not worth voting for. That being said, I feel like a lot of teams do mis-disclose in PF by just throwing up huge unedited blocks of texts in their open source section. Proper disclosure includes the tags that are in case and at least the first and last three words of a card that you\u2019ve read. To say you open source disclose requires highlighting of the words you have actually read in round.\nThat being said, answers that amount to whining aren\u2019t great. Teams that have PF theory read against them frequently respond in ways that mostly sound like they\u2019re confused/aghast that someone would question their integrity as debaters and at the end of the day that\u2019s not an argument. Teams should do more to articulate what specific calls to do x y or z actually do for the activity, rather than worrying about what they\u2019re feeling. If your coach requires you to do policy \u201cx\u201d then they should give you reasons to defend policy \u201cx.\u201d If you\u2019re consistently losing to arguments about what norms in the activity should look like, that\u2019s a talk you should have with your coach/program advisor about accepting them or creating better answers.\nIVIs\nThese are hands down the worst thing that PF debate has come up with. If something in round arises to the issue of student safety, then I hope(and maybe this is misplaced) that a judge would intervene prior to a debater saying \u201cdo something.\u201d If something is just a dumb argument, or a dumb way to have an argument be developed, then it\u2019s either a theory issue or a competitor needs to get better at making an argument against it.\nThe idea that these one-off sentences somehow protect students or make the activity more aware of issues is insane. Most things I\u2019ve heard called an IVI are misconstruing what a student has said, are a rules violation that need to be determined by tab, or are just an incomplete argument.\nKritiks\nOverall, I\u2019m sympathetic to these arguments made in any event, but I think that the PF version of them so far has left me underwhelmed. I am much better for things like cap, security, fem IR, afro-pess and the like than I am for anything coming from a pomo tradition/understanding. Survival strategies focused on identity issues that require voting one way or the other depending on a student\u2019s identification/orientation I think are bad for debate as a competitive activity.\nKritiks should require some sort of link to either the resolution(since PF doesn\u2019t have plans really), or something the aff has done argumentatively or with their rhetoric. The nonexistence of a link means a team has decided to rant for their speech time, and not included a reason why I should care.\nRejection alternatives are okay(Zizek and others were common when I was in debate for context) but teams reliant on \u201cdiscourse\u201d and other vague notions should probably strike me. If I do not know what voting for a team does, I am uncomfortable to do so and will actively seek out ways to avoid it.\n\n", "links": ["https://www.publicforumboot.camp"], "emails": ["blakedocs@googlegroups.com", "christian.vasquez212@gmail.com"], "scraped_at": "2024-01-09T14:22:40.103362Z", "hash": "8836a7226489cc11ea97fddb", "tab_tourn_id": 28021, "judge_id": "a1458df333dfcca42f3a3f91", "flow_confidence": 8, "progressive_confidence": 5}, {"html": "<div class=\"paradigm ltborderbottom\">\n<p>My name is William Mathison.
