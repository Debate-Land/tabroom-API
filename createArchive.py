This report is an archive of data from [tournaments.tech](http://tournaments.tech),
a site designed to standardize results and ranking for the national high school debate
circuit. The site and the api (which is open sourced and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/http-samc))
were coded and developed by [Samarth Chitgopekar](https://www.smrth.dev) and the formula used
for ranking debaters (the OTR Score) was developed by Adithya Vaidyanathan. The project was carefullly
crafted to be as accurate as possible, and though perfection isn't guarenteed due to the unstandardized
nature of [tabroom.com](https://tabroom.com) (the site we pull rankings from), we are by far
the most accurate source currently available.
